# Working Example

## Running LP API locally

To run the LP API locally, head to [this](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-partnernet) repo on Github and follow the instructions.

## Trying a working LP API

If you want to try out the Broker functionality, we have deployed and exposed this endpoint:

- [https://chainflip-lp-api-partnernet.chainflip.io](https://chainflip-lp-api-partnernet.chainflip.io)

<Callout type="warning">
  We strongly recommend operating your own APIs and never rely on 3rd parties.
  However, for testing purposes, feel free to use our LP API.
</Callout>

## Deploying Schema

LPs (and Brokers) should ideally run their own local RPC nodes. These nodes connect to the network and expose the LP & Broker APIs locally to the backend they want to use.

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid using the public RPC node since its particularly vulnerable to DDOS or
  other various attacks
