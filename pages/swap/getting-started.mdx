# Getting Started

The Chainflip Swapping works as a DEX aggregator. The typical journey from entering swap details like asset selection, amounts and best route are also present in the app. However, there are a few things that are different when it comes to sending funds and where.

As a cross-chain protocol, the chain where the deposit is made will be different from the destination chain, and therefore a (different) destination address is mandatory.

You can learn more about the [Swapping Basics](../integration/swapping-and-aggregation/swapping-basics.mdx).

## Sending funds: Deposit Channels

We make use of deposit channels to deposit funds into the protocol. A deposit is just a way to ingress funds into the protocol and provides incredible flexibility for the user for the following reasons:
- No specific wallet required
- A simple (and cheap) token transfer

To do so, a service called the *Broker* is responsible for opening a deposit channel and getting a deposit address in return. The resulting deposit channel (and address) is tied to the swap details and the destination address and can be verified using our Block Explorer.

You can learn more about how [Deposit Channels](../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers.mdx) and [Brokers](../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers.mdx#brokers) work.

Once the deposit address is ready, make sure you **send your funds while the channel is open, otherwise your funds might be lost**! 

<Callout type="warning">
Deposit channels expire after 24hs. The swapping app will stop displaying the deposit address an hour before expiration to account for confirmation delays. If the address expires, you can generate a new address.

### Direct Contract Call (EVM only)

Alternatively, you can connect your Ethereum wallet since a swap can also be triggered by calling the `swap()` function in Chainflip Vault contract. 

This offers a higher degree of control, as you don't need to interact with a Broker. However, it needs an extra transaction for token approval which leads to more gas.

<Callout type="warning">
This method is only available for EVM chains

## Maximum deposit amounts

These are the current maximum deposit amounts for this pre-release:

| Asset | Amount    |
|-------|-----------|
| ETH   | 0.5 ETH   |
| USDC  | 1000 USDC |
| FLIP  | 200 FLIP  |
| BTC   | 0,04 BTC  |
| DOT   | 200 DOT   |

<Callout type="warning">
The maximum deposit amounts are in place for pre-release only. Once we launch the full version, they will be removed.
</Callout>

## Minimum deposit amounts

These are the current minimum deposit amounts, required to account for protocol and gas fees:

| Asset | Amount    |
|-------|-----------|
| ETH   | 0.01 ETH  |
| USDC  | 20 USDC   |
| FLIP  | 4 FLIP    |
| BTC   | 0,0007 BTC|
| DOT   | 4 DOT     |

## Platform Fees
This section covers all fees involved during a Chainflip swap in detail.

### Network Fee

The most important fee as its a part of the protocol burning mechanism. For every pool (USDC denominated) a swap touches, a fixed fee is taken and used to buy $FLIP and automatically burned forever. This value is currently at 0.1%.

You can learn more about the crucial role of the Network Fee.

### Gas fee

These fees are network gas charged to collect funds from the deposit address (ingress) and send funds to the destination address (egress):
Deposit fee: For every deposit made, the network takes a small amount in the deposit asset. This value is currently at X%.
Broadcast fee: Once the swap is executed, the network takes a small amount of the swapped amount before sending it to the destination address. This value is currently at X%.

You can learn more by checking the [Swapping Fee Summary](../concepts/swaps-amm/native-swap-flow.mdx#swap-fees-in-summary) table.
