# Getting Started

There are a few things that are different when it comes to cross-chain swapping at Chainflip.

The most notable difference is the absence of **slippage tolerance or guaranteed minimum amount** to be received. This is due to the just-in-time liquidity nature of the [JIT Chainflip AMM](../concepts/swaps-amm/). Liquidity is actively deployed by LPs as they monitor upcoming swaps in the protocol. 

Our Swapping application displays a quoted rate from LPs, which is the best estimate at that time given the current liquidity — both deployed and undeployed. The difference between this rate and the global index price — which we get from Coingecko — is what we call the *price delta*.

You can learn in detail about the [Swapping Basics](../integration/swapping-and-aggregation/just-in-time-amm-protocol.mdx) at the protocol level.

## Sending funds: Deposit Channels

We make use of deposit channels to *ingress* funds into the protocol. A deposit channel is tied to a deposit address and provides an incredible flexibility to the user for the following reasons:
- No specific wallet required
- A simple (and cheap) token transfer

To achieve this, a service called the *Broker* is responsible for opening a deposit channel on behalf of users. The resulting deposit channel (and address) is associated with the swap details and the destination address. This information can be verified using our [Block Explorer](https://scan.chainflip.io/swaps).

All frontend applications need to interact with a Broker service, which means that any project looking to integrate Chainflip must [run their own Broker](/integration/swapping-and-aggregation/running-a-broker/introduction).

<Callout type="info">
You can learn more about how [Deposit Channels](../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers.mdx) and [Brokers](../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers.mdx#brokers) work in detail.

Once the deposit address is ready, **send your funds while the channel is open, otherwise your funds may be lost**!

<Callout type="warning">
Deposit channels expire after 24 hours. As a security measure, the Swapping application will hide the deposit address approximately one hour before it expires. However, if the address expires, you can always request a new one.

### Vault Smart Contract Call (EVM only)

<Callout type="info">
This method is only available for EVM chains
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can connect your Ethereum wallet, as a swap can also be triggered by calling the `swap()` function in the Vault smart contract.

This offers a higher level of control, as you don't need to interact with a *Broker*. However, it does require an additional transaction for token approval, which results in more gas being consumed.

<br />

In the swapping app, you can go to Settings and enable "Vault Smart Contract" calls by default to avoid using deposit channels.

## Deposit Caps

These are the current maximum deposit amounts for this pre-release:

| Asset | Amount    |
|-------|-----------|
| ETH   | 22 ETH   |
| USDC  | 50000 USDC |
| FLIP  | 10000 FLIP  |
| BTC   | 1,2 BTC  |
| DOT   | 7500 DOT   |

<Callout type="warning">
These deposit caps are in place for **pre-release only**. Once we officially launch, they will be removed.
</Callout>

## Minimum Deposit Amounts

Deposits below the minimum amount will be ignored and are effectively burned. These are the current minimum deposit amounts:

| Asset | Amount    |
|-------|-----------|
| ETH   | 0.01 ETH  |
| USDC  | 20 USDC   |
| FLIP  | 4 FLIP    |
| BTC   | 0,0007 BTC|
| DOT   | 4 DOT     |

## Platform Fees

This section covers all the fees involved in a Chainflip swap.

### Broker Fee

As mentioned above, the role of the Broker is to open deposit channels on behalf of users. To do this, Brokers must pay a small amount in $FLIP to cover gas and a *Channel Fee*. This is a network security mechanism to prevent spam. 

In the case of our Swapping app, **the Broker fee is zero**. However, projects integrating Chainflip may choose to charge a fee for the use of their *Broker* service, to offset the cost of running it. 

The fee can be set at any value **between 0 bps and 1000 bps** and can verified in the Block Explorer.

Here is an [example](https://scan.chainflip.io/channels/1550311-Ethereum-71):

<p align="center">
<img src="/swap/swapping_broker_fee.png" alt="swapping broker fee" width="300"/>
</p>

### Network Fee

The most important fee in the protocol as it is a part of the [burning mechanism](../concepts/token-economics/incentive-design-emission-and-burning#burn-mechanisms). The network fee is taken only **once per swap**, regardless of the pools (legs) involved, and used to buy \$FLIP. This $FLIP is then **burned forever**. 

<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="/swap/swapping_network_fee.png" alt="swapping network fee" width="300"/>
</p>

The current **value of the fee is 0.1%**. Learn more about the [impact of the Network Fee](http://localhost:3000/concepts/token-economics/incentive-design-emission-and-burning#the-network-fee).

### Liquidity Provider Fee

<Callout type="info">
Learn more about how [Liquidity Provider](../concepts/swaps-amm/liquidity-provider-accounts) accounts work.
</Callout>

A fixed liquidity fee is charged for each pool. Liquidity providers collect these fees from the positions they actively manage. This is referred to *Deployed liquidity* and each liquidity provider can be verified in our Explorer.

<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="/swap/swapping_lp_fees.png" alt="swapping lp fees" width="300"/>
</p>

The current values are:

| Pool      | Fee    |
|-----------|--------|
| BTC/USDC  | 0.15 % |
| ETH/USDC  | 0,10 % |
| FLIP/USDC | 0.10%  |
| DOT/USDC  | 0.10%  |

### Gas Fee

This fee refers to the State Chain gas involved during the processes of [Ingress](../concepts/validator-network/ingress-witnessing-deposits) and [Egres](../concepts/validator-network/egress-broadcasting-funds) of funds in the protocol.

- **Deposit Fee**: In order for Chainflip to allow users to send funds to a regular deposit address, the protocol must estimate the cost and deduct a fee for each deposit, as this will cost gas for most chains and assets this costs gas.

- **Broadcast Fee**: Similarly, to send the *swapped* funds to the destination address, the protocol must estimate and deduct a fee to cover the gas of sending funds to the destination chain.
