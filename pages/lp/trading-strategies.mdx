# Automated Trading Strategies

<Callout type="info">
This feature is available from version 1.9 onwards.
</Callout>

LPs can deploy funds from their account into a trading strategy, which will automatically create and manage limit orders on their behalf.
Each deployed strategy is assigned a unique id and in many ways is treated like a regular LP account by the protocol, e.g. it has its own account balance and starts with `cF...`.
When a strategy's order is filled (fully or partially), the funds are automatically returned to the strategy's account balance.
When the amount of free balance of some asset reaches a certain threshold, the strategy will automatically use it to create a new limit order (or update an existing one) according to the strategy's parameters.
When a strategy is closed, all of its orders are cancelled and the funds are returned to its free balance.


## Supported Strategies

The only strategy currently suported is `TickZeroCentered` which is suitable for trading stable coin pairs.

### TickZeroCentered

A simple strategy that trades in the `base_asset`/USDC pool, creating sell and buy orders at ticks `spread_tick`
and `-spread_tick`, respectively.

Parameters:

	- spread_tick: [Tick](integrations/lp-api/#tick),
	- base_asset: [Asset](integrations/lp-api/#asset)
