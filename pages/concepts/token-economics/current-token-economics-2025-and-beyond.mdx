# Current Token Economics 2025 & Beyond

## Introduction

FLIP is the core token of the Chainflip protocol, primarily securing the network through validator staking. Validators stake FLIP as collateral in auctions, earning emissions while maintaining the state chain and jointly controlling chain vaults.

As of 2025, FLIP is nearly fully circulating, with only a small portion of team allocations still vesting, and emissions. Treasury tokens making up the remaining are locked.

This section provides a breakdown of FLIPâ€™s current supply, emissions, and its role in network security.


## Current FLIP Supply & Circulation

**Snapshot taken on 13th March 2025.**

- **Total Supply:** 95,700,505 FLIP  
- **Circulating Supply:** 63,489,536 FLIP  
- **Treasury Allocation:** 22,000,000 FLIP _(Locked, and used for staking)_

## Remaining Unlocks & Emissions

While most FLIP supply is already in circulation, some scheduled unlocks and ongoing emissions remain:

- **Team Tokens:** Unlocking at a rate of **214,000 FLIP per month**.
- **Node Emissions:** **352,000 FLIP per month**, distributed as staking rewards to validators securing the network.

### **Post 2025 FLIP Release Schedule**

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** FLIP has passed through most of its unlock schedule, with protocol emissions & team vesting making up all unlocks.

## FLIP Buy-and-Burn: Long-Term Supply Impact

FLIP benefits from a built-in **deflationary mechanism** that counteracts emissions over time:

- **Network Fee Burn:** 0.1% of swap volume is used to **buy and burn FLIP**.
- **Boost Fee Burn:** 50% of all boost fees are burned, reducing supply.

### Deflationary Impact
These mechanisms remove FLIP from circulation, **increasing scarcity** and counteracting emissions.
