# Thesis and Introduction

The "Concepts" section breaks down the Chainflip protocol in a reasonably detailed manner, but only conceptually! We frequently update this entire site, including the [technical documentation](../mainnet/validator-setup/prerequisites.mdx) to assist you in setting up a Validator.

In Concepts, you will find information about the workings of the [core Chainflip protocol](system-overview.md), the purpose-designed and novel [JIT AMM protocol](swaps-amm/just-in-time-amm-protocol.md), as well as analyses of several other components and cryptoeconomics.&#x20;

## Thesis

For over a decade, the primary method of transferring value between blockchains has been the centralised exchange. While cross-chain solutions have emerged, none have achieved the widespread adoption and reliability needed to become the default choice for users and developers alike. Despite this, the vast majority of Web3 users rely on non-custodial wallets to perform even the simplest functions with DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and a myriad of other applications.

The landscape of cross-chain solutions has evolved significantly since 2020. While Uniswap continues to dominate DEX volume on Ethereum and its L2s, the broader cross-chain ecosystem has seen both successes and failures. Major bridge hacks and protocol exploits between 2021 and 2023 highlighted the importance of robust security in cross-chain infrastructure, while the rise of L2s and app-specific chains has only increased the need for reliable cross-chain communication.

Uniswap's success in creating deep on-chain liquidity and enabling programmatic trading has inspired numerous projects, but its impact remains largely confined to the Ethereum ecosystem and EVM-compatible chains. The fundamental challenge of secure, efficient value transfer between disparate blockchain ecosystems remains largely unsolved.

> While Uniswap revolutionized trading within the Ethereum ecosystem, the next frontier is enabling seamless value transfer between any blockchain, regardless of its underlying architecture.

The proliferation of L2s, app-specific chains, and alternative L1s has created a multi-chain reality that's here to stay. Each chain offers unique advantages in terms of scalability, security, or specialized functionality. However, this fragmentation has also created significant challenges for users and developers who need to operate across multiple ecosystems.

Since Chainflip's mainnet launch, the protocol has demonstrated that cross-chain swapping can be both secure and efficient without sacrificing decentralization. While other cross-chain solutions have emerged, many continue to face fundamental challenges:

* Reliance on complex bridge architectures that introduce additional attack vectors and points of failure
* Over-dependence on synthetic or wrapped assets that fragment liquidity and increase user risk
* Poor integration with existing wallet infrastructure and developer tools
* Inadequate price discovery mechanisms leading to suboptimal execution
* Complex user experiences that deter mainstream adoption

The ideal cross-chain solution should instead:

* Support any blockchain-native wallet without requiring special modifications or wrapped tokens
* Work with any blockchain regardless of its smart contract capabilities
* Minimize on-chain computation to reduce gas costs and improve efficiency
* Execute swaps atomically without leaving users exposed to bridging or unwrapping risks
* Provide simple, reliable APIs and SDKs that developers can easily integrate into their applications

Chainflip's mission remains focused on enabling truly permissionless cross-chain value transfer, making it as easy for developers to integrate cross-chain functionality as Uniswap made it to integrate token swaps. By solving these fundamental challenges, Chainflip aims to unlock the next wave of cross-chain innovation and bring us closer to a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem.
