title: System Overview

description: Sometimes called a “Cross-Chain Liquidity Network,” the core of the Chainflip idea is to use MPC (Multi-Party-Computation), and in particular TSS (Threshold Signature Schemes) to create aggregate keys held by a permissionless network of 150 Validators.

# System Overview

Chainflip is a decentralized protocol that enables native cross-chain swaps between different blockchains. At its core, it uses a network of 150 Validators who work together to control shared wallets (called Vaults) on multiple blockchains, allowing users to swap between native assets like BTC, ETH, and others without wrapping or bridging.

## Key Components

### The Validator Network

The protocol is run by 150 Validators who:

- Collectively control all funds in the system through FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signatures
- Process swaps and maintain the network state
- Monitor supported chains for deposits
- Execute withdrawals by signing transactions together
- Earn rewards for providing these services

Validator positions are permissionless - anyone can become a Validator by staking enough $FLIP tokens and winning a slot in periodic auctions.

### The State Chain

The State Chain is Chainflip's purpose-built blockchain that:

- Tracks all user balances and liquidity positions
- Coordinates the Validator network
- Processes swap orders and executes trades
- Manages the Just-In-Time (JIT) AMM system

Think of it as the "brain" of the protocol that coordinates everything happening across different blockchains.

### Vaults

Vaults are special wallets or smart contracts on each supported blockchain that:

- Hold all assets used for trading (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- Are collectively controlled by the Validator network
- Allow for secure deposits and withdrawals
- Enable native asset trading without wrapping

### The JIT AMM

Chainflip uses a unique Just-In-Time (JIT) AMM that:

- Is based on Uniswap v3 but also features limit orders that make it a intent-hybrid system
- Operates virtually on the State Chain rather than using smart contracts
- Allows for efficient pricing and execution of cross-chain swaps
- Supports limit orders and other advanced features

## How It All Works Together

When you make a swap through Chainflip:

1. You deposit native assets into a Vault on the source chain
2. The Validator network detects your deposit and updates your balance on the State Chain
3. The JIT AMM executes your swap virtually on the State Chain
4. The Validators work together to sign a withdrawal transaction from the destination chain's Vault
5. You receive native assets on the destination chain

This architecture allows Chainflip to:

- Support any blockchain, regardless of its smart contract capabilities
- Handle native assets without wrapping
- Execute swaps efficiently with minimal gas costs
- Provide a simple experience for both users and developers

The system is designed to be as decentralized and secure as possible, while still maintaining the speed and efficiency needed for practical cross-chain trading. In the following sections, we'll explore each of these components in more detail.
