title: Funding and Bidding

---

import { Callout } from "@/components";

Before your Validator is considered for the active set, you must fund your account with the necessary amount of FLIP, register it as a validator then signal to the chain that you want to start bidding.
To fund your validator, heat to the [auctions](https://auctions.chainflip.io/) app.

# Register Node as a Validator

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip register-account-role Validator
```

# Rotate Keys

Registration gives your account access to Validator-specific commands on the State Chain. The first of these is rotating and registering your authorship keys:

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip rotate
```

# Start Bidding

Now your node should be synced, your account be fully registered, your ports open, your Chainflip Engine humming along. Check the logs once more, check your node status in the web app, then crack your knuckles one more time and signal your intent to bid in the next auction:

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip start-bidding
```

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you rotate session keys and execute the commnad to start bidding, otherwise you won't be able to join auctions and eventually join the active validator set.
</Callout>

# Set Vanity Name

**Optionally**, you can set a Vanity Name for your validator by running:

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip vanity-name "my-cool-validator ðŸ˜Ž"
```

# Stop Bidding

If you want to retire a node and redeem all its funds, you will first need to signal your intent to stop bidding:

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip stop-bidding
```

This will ensure you don't participate in the next auction, and your funds will become unbonded. You can then redeem your funds.

> Note you may not stop bidding if the auction has already begun.
