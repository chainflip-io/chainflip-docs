# Prerequisites

This guide describes what you are going to need to successfully set a Chainflip validator node.

## ETH
You validator will need ETH to pay for transactions fees on the Ethereum network.

## FLIP
`FLIP` is used to pay transaction fees on Chainflip's State Chain.

## System Requirements

```
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 | Our binaries are not compiled on any other OS
CPU: 4GHz+ amd64/x86_64 CPU Architecture | We only support amd64/x86_64 CPU Architecture
RAM: 8GB+
SSD: 50GB+ NVMe (this may increase over time)
Bandwidth: Minimum 400MBps, Recommended 1GBps connection, 100 GB bandwidth combined up/down per month
```

This machine must be available 24/7 and thus it is recommended that you only try this on machines with a stable and reliable internet connection, such as a VPS or Dedicated Server. If you would like some help picking a server to rent, you can come to the Chainflip Community Discord and ask for help in the [`ðŸ› ï¸±technical-discussion`](https://discord.com/channels/824147014140952596/824147608377098241) or the [`ðŸ’¬-node-support`](https://discord.com/channels/824147014140952596/1096065647361925161) channels.

## Networking

### Firewall

You should ensure that all connections on ports `30333 (TCP)` and `8078 (TCP)` are not blocked! Some VPS providers enable an all-port firewall by default, but if this is not the case your node will not be able to participate in Keygen / Signing ceremonies and as a result will never become active.

### Static IP

To ensure uninterrupted operation of your node, you should setup your server to have a static public IP address. If your server gets a new IP address, you will need to update your node's configuration and restart it.
