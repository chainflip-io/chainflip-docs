# Upgrading from 0.8 to 0.9

## Prerequisites

Validator node running version `0.8` of the binaries.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you have changed the default paths of `chaindata` and/or `data.db`, make
  sure to manually delete those directories before running the upgrade commands.
</Callout>

## Overview

In short, this upgrade does the following

1. Downloads new `0.9` binaries.
2. Purges the chain data.
3. Removes old log files to free up some space.
4. Removes any existing systemd overrides.
5. Updates the Polkadot RPC endpoint.

## Upgrade Process

In order to upgrade your Validator from `0.8` to `0.9`, get the new binaries by running:

You might need to first update the Chainflip public signing key:

```bash copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL repo.chainflip.io/keys/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

Then paste the following in your terminal to migrate to `0.8`:

```shell copy
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/$(lsb_release -c -s) $(lsb_release -c -s) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt --only-upgrade install "chainflip-*"
```

Finally, **after the node is synced to the new chain** you'll need to rotate your keys again to be qualified for the next rotation.

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip rotate
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you get any errors after running the previous command, make sure your node
  is fully synced and that the engine is running before trying again.
</Callout>

## Post Upgrade

### Logs

Verify that your nodes is operating normally:

```bash copy
journalctl -f -u "chainflip-*"
```

### Exposing Chainflip Node Prometheus Metrics

As mentioned above, the upgrade process removes `systemd` overrides to avoid any instabilities during the upgrade process. After your node is successfully upgraded, you can add the overrides back by running the following:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/chainflip-node.service.d/
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/chainflip-node.service.d/override.conf >/dev/null
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/chainflip-node \
  --chain /etc/chainflip/perseverance.chainspec.json \
  --base-path /etc/chainflip/chaindata \
  --node-key-file /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file \
  --validator \
  --prometheus-external
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart chainflip-node.service
```

### Update Promtail Config

If you are streaming logs from your node to chainflip, please make sure to update the promtail config to add the new scraping config:

Run this to edit your promtail config file.

```bash copy
sudo nano /opt/promtail/chainflip-promtail.yaml
```

Then replace the existing scrape config with this:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: systemd
    journal:
      max_age: 12h
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ["__journal__systemd_unit"]
        target_label: "unit"
```

Finally restart promtail

```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart promtail
```

### Update the tFLIP contract address

Luckily for you, we have already moved all your previous funds from Perseverance `0.7` to the new tFLIP contract. However, Metamask does not allow you change the address, so you will need to import the new one. Follow the guide [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask#h_01FWH492CHY60HWPC28RW0872H) to do so.

<Callout type="info">
  The new `tFLIP` Token Contract Address is:
  **0x0485D65da68b2A6b48C3fA28D7CCAce196798B94**
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
For all those that would like their node to show up in **"My Nodes"**, you will need to stake any amount of new tFLIP **from the new contract** to your node. This should have been airdropped to most of you.

Paste in your existing Node ID and the balance will be restored in the app! [https://auctions-perseverance.chainflip.io/nodes](https://auctions-perseverance.chainflip.io/nodes)
