# Upgrading 0.9.3 -> 0.10.0

`0.10.0` includes the ability to specify a backup RPC node for each supported blockchain. As a result there have been some configuration file changes.

The migration of the configuration file should be done automatically. However, if you use environment variables or command line arguments, then please read the [Manual migration](#manual-migration) section.

<Callout type="warning">
    For Docker or Kubernetes users, see [here](#docker--kubernetes) for warnings about this release.
</Callout>


## Upgrade steps

Due to significant breaking changes we have decided to push the new engine version as an entirely new package: `chainflip-engine0.10`. Why you may ask? Well by doing it this way, we don't risk breaking your current setup, plus you can safely run both versions side by side.
We also avoid using error-prone `preinst` scripts.

<Callout type="warning">
    Any `systemd` overrides you have configured previously won't take effect. You will have to reconfigure them for the
    new package. Make sure to manually migrate them before upgrading.
</Callout>

```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --only-upgrade chainflip-*
```

Wait for the node to successfully restart. You can check that the node was successfully upgraded by running:

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-node -f
```
You should see an output similar to this, before you can proceed with upgrade:

```log

```

```bash copy
sudo apt install chainflip-engine0.10
sudo systemctl enable chainflip-engine0.10
sudo systemctl start chainflip-engine0.10
```

Check your logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-engine0.10 -f
```

You should see the following logs being repeated:

```
{"timestamp":"2023-10-18T12:58:25.219347Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"This version '0.10.0' is incompatible with the current release '0.9.3' at block: 0x4f75â€¦e036. WAITING for a compatible release version."},"target":"chainflip_engine::state_chain_observer::client"}
```

<Callout type="info">
    Your engine might report a log like `This version '0.10.0' is incompatible with the current release '0.0.0'`. This
    is fixed in `0.10.0` and can be ignored.
</Callout>


### AFTER the runtime upgrade

The currently installed package (`chainflip-engine`), will go into an idle mode. You can check this by running:

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-engine -f
```

You should see the following logs:

```
{"timestamp":"2023-10-18T13:55:01.469178Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Current runtime is not compatible with this CFE version (SemVer { major: 0, minor: 9, patch: 3 })"},"target":"chainflip_engine"}
```

Now double check that your new engine is running smoothly:

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-engine0.10 -f
```

Only at this point, you can safely shut down the old engine version.

<Callout type="error">
    We cannot stress this enough, DO NOT disable or stop the old engine (running 0.9.3) until we have pushed the new
    runtime upgrade AND you have confirmed that the new engine (running 0.10.0) is
    running successfully.
</Callout>

```bash copy
sudo systemctl stop chainflip-engine
sudo systemctl disable chainflip-engine
```

## Manual migration

If you use environment variables or command line arguments, or there was some problem when migrating the configuration file automatically, then you will need to migrate your settings manually.

Here's how to migrate each type of settings:


### Config file

Your Settings.toml file in **0.9.3** (for just the RPCs) configs would look something like this:

```toml
#... other settings

[eth]
# Ethereum private key file path. This file should contain a hex-encoded private key.
private_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file"
ws_node_endpoint = "WSS_ENDPOINT_OF_ETHEREUM_RPC"
http_node_endpoint = "HTTPS_ENDPOINT_OF_ETHEREUM_RPC"

[dot]
ws_node_endpoint = "wss://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"
http_node_endpoint = "https://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"

[btc]
http_node_endpoint = "http://a108a82b574a640359e360cf66afd45d-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
rpc_user = "flip"
rpc_password = "flip"

#... other settings...
```

For 0.10.0, you want to change the configuration file so it looks something like this:

```toml
#... other settings...

[eth]
# Ethereum private key file path. This file should contain a hex-encoded private key.
private_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file"

[eth.rpc]
ws_endpoint = "WSS_ENDPOINT_OF_ETHEREUM_RPC"
http_endpoint = "HTTPS_ENDPOINT_OF_ETHEREUM_RPC"

# [eth.backup_rpc]
# ws_endpoint = "SECOND_WSS_ENDPOINT_OF_ETHEREUM_RPC"
# http_endpoint = "SECOND_HTTPS_ENDPOINT_OF_ETHEREUM_RPC"

[dot.rpc]
ws_endpoint = "wss://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"
http_endpoint = "https://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"

[btc.rpc]
http_endpoint = "http://a108a82b574a640359e360cf66afd45d-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
basic_auth_user = "flip"
basic_auth_password = "flip"

# [btc.backup_rpc]
# http_endpoint = "http://second-node-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
# basic_auth_user = "flip2"
# basic_auth_password = "flip2"

#... other settings...
```

Note the following changes:
- `eth` -> `eth.rpc` (same for `dot` and `btc`) for the *rpc* endpoint configuration.
- `rpc_user` and `rpc_password` for `btc` are now `basic_auth_user` and `basic_auth_password` respectively
- The `backup_rpc` sections are commented out. You can uncomment them and add the backup nodes if you wish
- `ws_node_endpoint` -> `ws_endpoint` and `http_node_endpoint` -> `http_endpoint`


Initially, we recommend not using the `backup_rpc`s, just to ensure the migration is successful. Once you're running smoothly then we recommend adding a backup node.

<Callout type="info">
    For perseverance we use a Chainflip-run private Polkadot network. Thus, adding
    a `backup_rpc` for Polkadot is not necessary.
</Callout>

### Environment variables

The names of the environment variables have changed:

<Callout type="info">
    Note the `__` (double underscore) in the variable names. This is necessary.
</Callout>

```
# ETH
ETH__HTTP_NODE_ENDPOINT -> ETH__RPC__HTTP_ENDPOINT
ETH__WS_NODE_ENDPOINT -> ETH__RPC__WS_ENDPOINT

# DOT
DOT__WS_NODE_ENDPOINT -> DOT__RPC__WS_ENDPOINT
DOT__HTTP_NODE_ENDPOINT -> DOT__RPC__HTTP_ENDPOINT

# BTC
BTC__HTTP_NODE_ENDPOINT -> BTC__RPC__HTTP_ENDPOINT
BTC__RPC_USER -> BTC__RPC__BASIC_AUTH_USER
BTC__RPC_PASSWORD -> BTC__RPC__BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD

```

The environment variables for the backup nodes are:

```
# ETH
ETH__BACKUP_RPC__HTTP_ENDPOINT
ETH__BACKUP_RPC__WS_ENDPOINT
# DOT
DOT__BACKUP_RPC__WS_ENDPOINT
DOT__BACKUP_RPC__HTTP_ENDPOINT
# BTC
BTC__BACKUP_RPC__HTTP_ENDPOINT
BTC__BACKUP_RPC__BASIC_AUTH_USER
BTC__BACKUP_RPC__BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
```

### Command line arguments

The command line arguments have changed like so:
```
# ETH
--eth.http_node_endpoint -> --eth.rpc.http_endpoint
--eth.ws_node_endpoint -> --eth.rpc.ws_endpoint
# DOT
--dot.ws_node_endpoint -> --dot.rpc.ws_endpoint
--dot.http_node_endpoint -> --dot.rpc.http_endpoint
# BTC
--btc.http_node_endpoint -> --btc.rpc.http_endpoint
# NB: There's no ".rpc" in these two below. This will soon be fixed to be consistent in a future release.
--btc.rpc_user -> --btc.basic_auth_user
--btc.rpc_password -> --btc.basic_auth_password
```



If you would like to specify the backups via command line arguments, you can use these:

```
# ETH
--eth.backup_rpc.http_endpoint <ETH_BACKUP_HTTP_ENDPOINT>
--eth.backup_rpc.ws_endpoint <ETH_BACKUP_WS_ENDPOINT>
# DOT
--dot.backup_rpc.http_endpoint <DOT_BACKUP_HTTP_ENDPOINT>
--dot.backup_rpc.ws_endpoint <DOT_BACKUP_WS_ENDPOINT>
# BTC
--btc.backup_rpc.http_endpoint <BTC_BACKUP_HTTP_ENDPOINT>
--btc.backup_rpc.basic_auth_user <BTC_BACKUP_RPC_USER>
--btc.backup_rpc.basic_auth_password <BTC_BACKUP_RPC_PASSWORD>
```

<Callout type="info">
    You can use `chainflip-engine --help` to see all the available command line
    options.
</Callout>


## Docker / Kubernetes

Upgrading via Docker or Kubernetes is a little more involved. The issue lies in the fact that Kubernetes requires that
we define the ports and port names beforehand and they cannot clash. The config files for each engine would have to support two different ports!
Therefore, running two versions of the engine side
by side can be tricky. One would have to define the engine port names differently for each version. Also, there is the
problem that the new engine needs to be able to access the data.db directory. Unless you are running some kind of NFS
setup, which allows ReadWriteMany configuration, you will likely not be able to mount volume for the data.db directory
to two separate pods. This means you would have to run both engine containers within a single pod. This is not ideal,
but it is possible.

<Callout type="warning">
    Our Helm charts will not support this setup. You will have to modify the YAML yourself.
</Callout>

For this particular upgrade, and for simplicityâ€™s sake, it would be okay for you to wait until the new runtime versions
has been pushed and upgrade your image version after this.
