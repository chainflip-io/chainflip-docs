# Advanced Account Management

These are some features that advanced operators should be aware of.

## Redeem Address Binding

Any account may be explicitly *bound* to a single redemption address. Henceforth, any redemption request from that account can *only redeem to this exact address*.

<Callout type="warning">
  Note, address binding is a one-off *irreversible* operation.
</Callout>

> *Example:*
>
> *The account `cFc00Ld00d` is bound to the redeem address `0xdeadbeef`. This was a bad idea since it's unlikely that `cFc00Ld00d` knows the private key for `0xdeadbeef`, so his or her funds are effectively permanently locked. Do not do this.*
>
> *Example:*
>
> *A liquid staking provider wants to allow users to pool their FLIP through a smart contract on Ethereum, to then fund a validator account. They bind their validator account to the smart contract address. This binding is permanent and irrevocable, so users can now rest assured that there is no way the pooled funds can be redeemed to any other address.*

In order to bind a redemption address, use the `chainflip-cli`. Log on to the node that contains the keys to the account for which you want to bind a redemption address.

In order to check if the account is currently bound to a redemption address:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli get-bound-redeem-address
```

In order to permanently bind a redeem address:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli bind-redeem-address <ETH_ADDRESS>
```

## Redemption Execution Address Binding

> Note: At the time of writing, executor binding via the CLI is not yet supported on Perseverance network. This feature is planned for release as of version 0.9.4.

Similar to the above, redemptions can be restricted such that only a single specific Ethereum address can be the *executor* of a redemption.

In order to bind an executor address, proceed as above using the `chainflip-cli`.

Query for any currently bound address like so:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli get-bound-executor-address
```

In order to permanently bind an executor address:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli bind-executor-address <ETH_ADDRESS>
```

## Restricted Balances

Certain funding *sources* are considered restricted, such that funds originating from that source can only be redeemed back to whence they came. In order to enforce this, we track the amount of funds added from restricted addresses and ensure that the account always has enough funds to cover its obligations to these addresses.

This is used primarily to enforce vesting restrictions. Some of the FLIP tokens in existence may be locked in a vesting contract that controls when the tokens can be freely accessed. In the meantime, we still would like the tokens to be used productively in the protocol. However this is not possible without restricting the funds, since otherwise the vesting restrictions can be trivially circumvented by funding an account and immediately redeeming to any other address.

> *Example:*
>
> *The address `0xabc` is marked as restricted because it is a smart contract holding FLIP for early investors.*
>
> *Imagine an account has 1,000 FLIP funded from address `0xabc` and earns a return of 10 FLIP after some period of time. Subject to other restrictions (bond etc.) those 10 FLIP can be redeemed to any address. Any more than that can only be redeemed from the restricted balance of 1,000 FLIP, and only to the originating address `0xabc`.*
