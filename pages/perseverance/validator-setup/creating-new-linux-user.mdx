# Creating a new Linux User

Using the `root` user to run a Validator works. However, it is a good security practice to create a separate user with limited access to run the Chainflip binaries.

You can call the new user whatever you like. In the following commands we will call it `flip`.

## Create the user

```bash copy
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/flip/ -m -G sudo flip
```

This command does the following:&#x20;

- Creates a user called `flip`
- Creates a home directory for the new user under`/home/flip`
- Sets the default shell for the new user to `/bin/bash`
- Adds the `flip` user to the sudo group which gives the user the required access and permissions to install and configure the required software.

## Add a Password

It is recommended to add a password to your newly created user. You can do that by running:

```bash copy
sudo passwd flip
```

You'll then be prompted to enter a password then re-enter it for validation.

Congrats, your new user is now protected with a password 🔐

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to memorize this password as you'll need it in the rest of the
  documentation whenever you execute a command with `sudo`
</Callout>

## Setup SSH Access

To be able to login over ssh using the new user we will need to set it up by running the following commands:

```bash copy
mkdir /home/flip/.ssh
sudo cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/flip/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown -R flip:flip /home/flip/.ssh/
sudo chmod 0700 /home/flip/.ssh/
```

The commands above do the following:&#x20;

- `mkdir /home/flip/.ssh`: creates a new directory called `.ssh` that holds the SSH config for `flip` user.
- `sudo cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/flip/.ssh/authorized_keys`: copies the public keys whose private keys are allowed to access the machine from the `root` to `flip` user.
- `sudo chown -R flip:flip /home/flip/.ssh/`: changes the ownership of the directory to `flip` user.
- `sudo chmod 0700 /home/flip/.ssh/`: changes the permissions of the `.ssh` directory.&#x20;

Next time you want to SSH into your server using the user you created, you can run:&#x20;

```bash copy
ssh flip@<YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
```

But for now you don't need to logout in order to switch users, you can do that simply by running:&#x20;

```bash copy
su - flip
```
