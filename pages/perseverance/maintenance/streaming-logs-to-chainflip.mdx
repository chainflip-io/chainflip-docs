# Streaming Logs to Chainflip

Because life is shorter than downloading 4.9GB worth of logs over SSH, you can optionally stream your node and engine logs to our community [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) Server.

## Setup

To set this up you'll need to install and setup [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail).

### Get Promtail

Simply run the following commands to get the latest version of promtail:

```bash copy
PROMTAIL_VERSION="2.8.1"
sudo mkdir /opt/promtail
sudo wget -qO /opt/promtail/promtail.gz "https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v${PROMTAIL_VERSION}/promtail-linux-amd64.zip"
sudo gunzip /opt/promtail/promtail.gz
sudo chmod a+x /opt/promtail/promtail
sudo ln -s /opt/promtail/promtail /usr/local/bin/promtail

## Versify the installation
promtail -version

```

### Add Promtail Config

Add the following config to instruct Promtail to only send logs from `/var/logs/chainflip-engine.log` and `/var/log/chainflip-node.log`

Create a config file by running:

```bash copy
sudo nano /opt/promtail/chainflip-promtail.yaml
```

Then copy and paste the following:

```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: /opt/promtail/positions.yaml

client:
  external_labels:
    network: "perseverance"
    host: "your_node_public_ip_address"
    vanity: "your_node_vanity_name"
    ss58Address: "your_node_id"
  url: https://loki-community.chainflip.xyz/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: systemd
    journal:
      max_age: 12h
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ["__journal__systemd_unit"]
        target_label: "unit"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you update **`vanity`** (line 12) and **`ss58Address`** (line 13) to
  match the values for your node. You can get these values from the [Auctions
  App](https://auctions-perseverance.chainflip.io/nodes)
</Callout>

Save the file and exit by hitting `CTRL+x` then typing `y` and finally hitting `Enter`.

### Configure Promtail Service

In order for Promtail to keep running in the background, you'll configure a `systemd` service.

Simply run:

```bash copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/promtail.service
```

Then copy and paste the following:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Promtail client for sending logs to Loki
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/promtail/promtail -config.file=/opt/promtail/chainflip-promtail.yaml
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
TimeoutStopSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the file and exit by hitting `CTRL+x` then typing `y` and finally hitting `Enter`.

Finally, restart the `systemd` daemon for changes to take effect, then enable and start `promtail`:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable promtail.service
sudo systemctl start promtail.service
```

Check if everything is running smoothly:

```bash copy
systemctl status promtail.service
```

The output should be something like:

```bash copy
‚óè promtail.service - Promtail
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/promtail.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2023-04-11 11:40:11 UTC; 15min ago
   Main PID: 269769 (promtail)
      Tasks: 11 (limit: 9508)
     Memory: 23.9M
     CGroup: /system.slice/promtail.service
             ‚îî‚îÄ269769 /opt/promtail/promtail -config.file=/opt/promtail/chainflip-promtail.yaml
```

You can get log from promtail by running:

```
journalctl -f -u promtail.service
```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Promtail to stream logs to Chainflip! üéâ

## Is this Okay?

If you see something like when checking Promtail logs:

```log
Apr 11 19:29:55 localhost promtail[3334372]: level=warn ts=2023-04-11T23:29:55.498899392Z caller=client.go:419 component=client host=loki-community.chainflip.xyz msg="error sending batch, will retry" status=429 tenant= error="server returned HTTP status 429 Too Many Requests (429): entry with timestamp 2023-04-11 23:29:55.434747521 +0000 UTC ignored, reason: 'Per stream rate limit exceeded (limit: 3MB/sec) while attempting to ingest for stream '{filename="/var/log/chainflip-engine.log", network="perseverance", ss58Address="cFJQy58CJKJhNCBnV89qQhcQYQSgC6cg8dGWiTJb8xqWsMyQ3", unit="chainflip-engine.service", vanity="djterminator.eth#2704"}' totaling 201B, consider splitting a stream via additional labels or contact your Loki administrator to see if the limit can be increased' for stream: {filename="/var/log/chainflip-engine.log", network="perseverance", ss58Address="cFJQy58CJKJhNCBnV89qQhcQYQSgC6cg8dGWiTJb8xqWsMyQ3", unit="chainflip-engine.service", vanity="djterminator.eth#2704"},"

```

**Don't worry!** This is a precautionary step to stop our server from being overwhelmed. When you initiate log streaming, Promtail will try to transmit all your logs, which could amount to several gigabytes. Consequently, your requests will be restricted until the batches you submit decrease in size.
