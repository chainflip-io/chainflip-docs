# Streaming Metrics to Chainflip

Node operators often fear the prospect of being **slashed**, which is a prevalent issue. The causes can vary widely, from network disruptions to a lack of available disk space to running on under-resourced machines.

To assist Chainflip in understanding why your node is experiencing slashing, streaming your node metrics would be highly advantageous. Chainflip asks that you install [process-exporter](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter) and [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) on your machines, so that we can scrape metrics using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

## Overview

The setup consists of the following components:

1. Install Node Exporter and Process Exporter.
2. Add configuration files.
3. Update your `chainflip-node` `systemd` file to expose substrate prometheus metrics.
4. Ensure that ports on your node are exposed to allow our Prometheus instance to access and scrape your metrics.

## Install Node Exporter

### Download Node Exporter Binary <a href="#download-node-exporter" id="download-node-exporter"></a>

```bash copy
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### Create `node_exporter` User

```bash copy
sudo groupadd -f node_exporter
sudo useradd -g node_exporter --no-create-home --shell /bin/false node_exporter
sudo mkdir -p /etc/node_exporter
sudo chown node_exporter:node_exporter /etc/node_exporter
```

### Unpack and Install Node Exporter Binary

```bash copy
tar -xvf node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64 node_exporter-files

sudo cp node_exporter-files/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter

# Clean Up
rm -rf node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz node_exporter-files
```

### Setup Node Exporter Service

Run the following command to create a service file:

```bash copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

Then copy and paste the following into the service file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Node Exporter
Documentation=https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=node_exporter
Group=node_exporter
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter --web.listen-address=:9100

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit (CTRL+x then hit `y` then hit `Enter`)

Change the file permissions:

```bash copy
sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

### Reload `systemd` and start the Node Exporter Service

```bash copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your firewall exposes port `9100` publicly.
</Callout>

### Check the Whole Setup

#### Check the status of Node Exporter

```bash copy
sudo systemctl status node_exporter
```

You should see something like the following:

<img src="/perseverance/image (3).png" alt="" />

#### Check whether Metrics are accessible

You can also verify that your node is exposing metrics by navigating to this url in a web browser:

```markdown
http://<your_node_public_ip_address>:9100/metrics
```

You should see the raw metrics that the node exporter exposes:

<img src="/perseverance/image (2).png" alt="" />

<Callout type="info">
  If you aren't able to access the metrics, double check your firewall settings
  and make sure port **`9100`** is exposed and publicly accessible.
</Callout>

## Install Process Exporter

Setting up Process Exporter is a similar process as in the previous section.

<Callout type="warning">
  The following commands are similar to the ones in the previous section but
  they are **not** the same. make sure to execute them in order.
</Callout>

### Download Process Exporter Binary <a href="#download-process-exporter" id="download-process-exporter"></a>

```bash copy
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/download/v0.7.10/process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### Create `process_exporter` User <a href="#create-user" id="create-user"></a>

```bash copy
sudo groupadd -f process_exporter
sudo useradd -g process_exporter --no-create-home --shell /bin/false process_exporter
sudo mkdir /etc/process_exporter
sudo chown process_exporter:process_exporter /etc/process_exporter
```

### Unpack and Install Process Exporter Binary <a href="#unpack-node-exporter-binary" id="unpack-node-exporter-binary"></a>

```bash copy
tar -xvf process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64 process_exporter-files

sudo cp process_exporter-files/process-exporter /usr/local/bin/process_exporter
sudo chown process_exporter:process_exporter /usr/local/bin/process_exporter

# Clean Up
rm -rf process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz process_exporter-files
```

### Create Process Exporter Config File

```bash copy
sudo nano /etc/process_exporter/process-exporter.yaml
```

Then copy and paste the following into the file:

```yaml
process_names:
  - comm:
      - chainflip-node
      - chainflip-engine
```

### Setup Process Exporter Service

Run the following command to create a service file:

```bash copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/process_exporter.service
```

Then copy and paste the following into the service file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Process Exporter for Prometheus
Documentation=https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=process_exporter
Group=process_exporter
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/process_exporter \
  --config.path /etc/process_exporter/process-exporter.yaml \
  --web.listen-address=:9256

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and exit (CTRL+x then hit `y` then hit `Enter`)

Change the file permissions:

```bash copy
sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/process_exporter.service
```

### Reload `systemd` and start the Node Exporter Service

```bash copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start process_exporter
sudo systemctl enable process_exporter.service
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your firewall exposes port **`9256`** publically.
</Callout>

### Check the Whole Setup

#### Check the status of Process Exporter

```bash copy
sudo systemctl status process_exporter
```

You should see something like the following:

<img src="/perseverance/image (7).png" alt="" />

#### Check whether Metrics are accessible

You can also verify that your node is exposing metrics by navigating to in a web browser:

```markdown
http://<your_node_public_ip_address>:9256/metrics
```

You should see the raw metrics that the process exporter exposes:

<img src="/perseverance/image.png" alt="" />

<Callout type="info">
  If you aren't able to access the metrics, double check your firewall settings
  and make sure port **`9256`** is exposed and publically accessible.
</Callout>

## Expose Prometheus metrics for `chainflip-node`

`chainflip-node` is built using [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) which uses Prometheus natively to expose metrics.&#x20;

To make those metrics available you will have to override the default `systemd` file that ships with the package. To do so run the following:

```bash copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/chainflip-node.service.d/
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/chainflip-node.service.d/override.conf >/dev/null
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/chainflip-node \
  --chain /etc/chainflip/perseverance.chainspec.json \
  --base-path /etc/chainflip/chaindata \
  --node-key-file /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file \
  --validator \
  --prometheus-external
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart chainflip-node.service
```

<Callout type="info">
  Notice the **`--prometheus-external`** flag we added to instruct the node
  binary to expose the metrics. These are not exposed by default.
</Callout>

If you want to learn more about `systemd` overrides, please refer to this page:

[Modifying your systemd config](../modifying-your-systemd-config.md)

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your firewall exposes port **`9615`** publicly.
</Callout>

#### Check whether Metrics are accessible

You can also verify that your node is exposing metrics by navigating to in a web browser:

```markdown
http://<your_node_public_ip_address>:9615/metrics
```

You should see the raw metrics that `chainflip-node` exposes:

<img src="/perseverance/image (4).png" alt="" />

<Callout type="info">
  If you aren't able to access the metrics, double check your firewall settings
  and make sure port **`9615`** is exposed and publicly accessible.
</Callout>

Congratulations! You are successfully collecting metrics. 😎🎉

## Update your `promtail` Config

<Callout type="warning">
  If you haven't set up **`promtail`** yet, check the docs to do so
  [here](streaming-logs-to-chainflip.md).
</Callout>

In order to make it easier to connect the logs from your node to the metrics outlined in this tutorial, you need to add an extra label to the configuration file of your node under `/opt/promtail/chainflip-promtail.yaml`.

```bash copy
sudo nano /opt/promtail/chainflip-promtail.yaml
```

Then add a new label:

`host: "your_node_public_ip_address"`

Your config looks something like this:&#x20;

<img src="/perseverance/image (8).png" alt="" />

Save your changes and restart promtail:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart promtail.service
sudo systemctl status promtail.service
```

## Expose Prometheus metrics for `chainflip-engine`

The `chainflip-engine` integrates prometheus natively to expose metrics.

To make those metrics available you will have to modify the engine config which can be modified with the following command:
```shell copy
sudo nano /etc/chainflip/config/Settings.toml
```

and add the following settings:

```toml
[prometheus]
hostname = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5566
```
<Callout type="warning">
  You need to restart the engine to apply the changes!. Be sure to scrape the metrics if you enable them, otherwise the engine will run out of memory over time.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your firewall exposes port **`5566`** publicly if you want to make this metrics available for Chainflip.
</Callout>

#### Check whether Metrics are accessible

You can also verify that your node is exposing metrics by navigating to in a web browser:

```markdown
http://<your_node_public_ip_address>:5566/metrics
```

#### Some useful metrics that are exposed:
Metrics are presented by their name and the labels they use.
- unauthorized_ceremony ["chain", "type"]: the number of unauthorized ceremonies an engine has active, all ceremonies should transition to an authorized state when the request is received from the state chain. If we start seeing this metric increasing it could mean that a validator is being spammed with fake ceremonies from a malicious actor, or that his node has lost connection with the other peers and hence it is not able to receive updates about the state of the network
- p2p_active_connections: counts the number of active connections (peer), this should be at least equal to the number of validators in the authority set, otherwise it means that we are not connected with some of them which is required in order to complete the ceremonies.
- p2p_msg_received: count all the messages received by the engine, if this metric doesn't grow over time (when the network is fully operational and ceremonies are more common than once every few days) it is likely a problem regarding the configuration of the system, check the config file and be sure that the port stated there is reachable and open.
```toml
[node_p2p]
node_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file"
ip_address = "IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE"
port = "8078"
```
- rpc_requests ["client", "rpc_method"]: The number of “planned” rpc request the engine is making, without keeping into account the number of retrials. Using this in combination with rpc_requests_total can help detect a malfunction of one/more endpoints.
- rpc_requests_total ["client","rpc_method"]: The number of total rpc request the engine is making, it keeps into account the number of retrials as well. This metric should be used with rpc_request to calculate a ratio (I.E. `(rate(sum by(client) (rpc_requests) [5m:])) / (rate(sum by(client) (rpc_requests_total) [5m:])) * 100` calculates the successful % of request made in the last 5m for every client) if this ratio starts dropping it means that there is a problem with the specified client (which directly point to an endpoint).
The rpc clients are used to perform http request while the subscribe ones are used to open a websocket connection.
The clients can be: **btc_rpc, dot_rpc, dot_subscribe, eth_rpc, eth_subscribe**.
