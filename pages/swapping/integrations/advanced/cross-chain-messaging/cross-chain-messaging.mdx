# Cross-Chain Messaging

## Introduction

Cross-chain messaging allows for developers to send messages cross-chains along with a swap. Cross-chain messaging swaps follow the same flow as regular swaps but with the addition of a message that is sent to a receiver contract on the destination chain.

As described in [How Swapping Works](../../../how-swapping-works.md), swaps in Chainflip can be initiated via requesting a deposit address or via a smart contract call (only in EVM chains). Both of those methods support cross-chain messaging by specifying a `message` parameter and a `gasBudget` parameter. The SDK makes it seemless to [request a deposit address with CCM](../../javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address.md#requestdepositaddress--cross-chain-messaging-ccm) or [execute a swap with CCM](../vault-swaps.md#receive-call-and-asset-on-the-receiver-contract).

More details in the EVM smart contract implementation can be found in the [EVM vault implementation](../vault-swaps.md#swap--call-a-receiver-with-cross-chain-messaging).

## Chains supported

The following chains are supported for cross-chain messaging as destination chains:

- EVM Chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum)
- Solana

## Implementation Checklist

- The destination chain needs to be a Chainflip supported CCM-compatible chain.
- The swap must be initiated by requesting a deposit address or via a smart contract call specifying the extra specifying the `message` and the `gasBudget` parameters in both cases.
- The message should be shorter than 10k bytes.
- The **gas budget needs to be paid upfront** on the source chain as part of initiating the swap. In the future, Chainflip might support paying the gas budget on the destination chain.
- The **gas budget provided needs to be sufficient to cover the gas costs of the receiver's logic on the destination chain**.
- The receiver on the destination chain needs to be a smart contract with the interface described for the destination chain, either [EVM](../vault-swaps.md#receive-call-and-asset-on-the-receiver-contract) or [Solana](TODO).
- The receiver on the destination chain needs to ensure that the receiving logic won't revert.

Depending on the destination chain there are some extra considerations that need to be taken into account. Check out [EVM considerations](./evm-ccm#considerations) and/or [Solana considerations](./sol-ccm#considerations)
