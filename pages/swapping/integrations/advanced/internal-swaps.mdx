# Internal Swaps

Users that already have funds on Chainflip (currently limited to [liquidity providers](../../../lp/introduction)) can initiate swaps (called "internal swaps") directly from their account balance.
The output of a successful internal swap (as well as any refunded amount) is credited directly to the user's account balance.
Because internal swaps don't require any interaction with external chains, they come with a number of benefits:

- Internal swaps are faster to initiate since the funds are immediately available (note, however, that the standard 2 block delay between scheduling and executing a swap is still applied).
- Internal swaps are cheaper since the user does not pay the ingress and egress [fees](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/native-swap-flow#swap-fees-in-summary).

To initiate a swap the user can use the [liquidity provider API](../../../lp/integrations/lp-api#lp_schedule_swap).
