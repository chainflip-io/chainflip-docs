# Affiliate Brokers

When opening a swap deposit channel, in addition to their own commission rate, brokers can optionally specify a list of up to five additional *Affiliate Brokers* which each also earn commission.

Typically this feature might be used by, for example, a Broker API Provider: The API could allow affiliates to request swap deposit channels though the Broker's own account, in exchange for a share of commission.

A Broker API Provider offers you the benefit to easily integrate with Chainflip without having to set up and maintain a Chainflip Node and Broker API yourself.

See the [API documentation](broker-api#broker_request_swap_deposit_address) for further information.

<Callout type="warning">
Affiliate Brokers must be existing registered [Broker accounts](broker-api.mdx#2-registering-the-account).
