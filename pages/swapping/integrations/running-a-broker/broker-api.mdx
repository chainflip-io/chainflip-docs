# Broker API

The Broker API is a standalone client that exposes _Broker_ functionality via a JSON API interface. It can be obtained from the same location as the chainflip-node, i.e. you can install it via `apt`, use the provided docker image or compile it yourself from the sources on Github.

Brokers need to run the client for the API themselves, as the Broker holds keys used to sign extrinsics and collect any fees set for [Deposit Channels](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers). The API client works by pointing it to an RPC node — also run by the same Broker, ideally.

## 1. Running Broker API locally

Before you do anything, you need to generate a valid [signing_key](../chainflip-account/creating) and [fund](../chainflip-account/funding) the associated account.
If you are planning to use [our Docker setup](#option-b-running-the-broker-api-with-docker-compose), instructions on how to generate new keys and fund your account are provided in the github repo.

### Option A: Using the pre-compiled binaries

Download the `chainflip-broker-api` software and the `chainflip-node`:

```bash copy
apt-get install chainflip-broker-api
apt-get install chainflip-node
```

Generate a new signing key:

```bash copy
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/chainflip-cli chainfliplabs/chainflip-cli:berghain-1.6.7 generate-keys --json > broker-keys.json

mkdir -p /etc/chainflip/keys
cat broker-keys.json | jq -r '.signing_account_id' > /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

For a full list of command line arguments, see `chainflip-broker-api --help` and `chainflip-node --help`.

To use the default configuration, run:

- Testnet
```bash copy
chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/perseverance.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe --sync=warp

chainflip-broker-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure the signing key file is not exposed. Access to this key gives full control over the Broker account.
</Callout>

- Mainnet
```bash copy
chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/berghain.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe --sync=warp

chainflip-broker-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid exposing the broker-api publicly with these settings, as anyone could redeem your earned fees!
</Callout>

### Option B: Running the Broker API with Docker Compose

Alternatively, for a quick start with the Broker API, we have provided a docker-compose setup that runs the Broker API and a State Chain node (required).

- [Perseverance Testnet Setup](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-perseverance)
- [Mainnet Setup](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-mainnet-apis)

### Option C: Running the Broker API in Kubernetes

Chainflip maintains a helm chart for running the Broker API in Kubernetes.

- [Broker API Helm Chart](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/broker-api)

This setup requires a running instance of the State Chain (`chainflip-node`). You can use this helm chart to deploy the Broker API and the State Chain in the same Kubernetes cluster.

- [Node Helm Chart](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/node)

## 2. Registering the account

After being funded, before you can fully interact with the Broker API, your account needs to be [registered](#broker_register_account) as a Broker account.

### Command line arguments and defaults

- The `state_chain.ws_endpoint` should point at a **synced Chainflip State Chain RPC node**. The default is `ws://localhost:9944` — assuming it is run locally.
- The `state_chain.signing_key_file` should be a path to a file containing the hex-encoded **private key** for the on-chain Broker account. The default file path is `/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file`. The account should be [funded](/mainnet/validator-setup/funding-and-bidding#adding-funds-to-your-validator-node) and the account role should be set to Broker.
- The `port` is the port on which the Broker API will listen for connections. Use `0` to assign a random port. The default is `80`.
- New functionality available from version 1.7+: The `health_check.hostname` and `health_check.port` describe the hostname and port where the Broker API will listen for health check requests. Both arguments have to be specified for the health check server to start.

### `broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection`

Request an incoming transaction to be rejected. Only available for bitcoin. This call will always succeed, but the transaction will
only be refunded if it hasn't been witnessed on-chain yet. For un-boosted channels this means prior to 6 blocks confirmation, for boosted 
channels its prior to 1 block confirmation, i.e. only while the transaction is in the mempool. Also, a broker can only mark transactions
going into its own deposit-channels for rejection.

Parameters:
- `tx_id`: The transaction id of the transaction to be rejected. Only bitcoin is supported, the transaction hash has to be specified as shown in
the example below. Also, note that the byte order of the hash is *in reverse* to the usual representation in bitcoin block explorers.

Return:
- Nothing if transaction was successfully marked for rejection, error message otherwise.

Example input:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection", "params": {"tx_id": {"Bitcoin": "0x736c159fec96ea84b8eceb49258019625a17e68ab981a3a674261e1df00a0482"}}}' | jq
```

Example output (success):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "null",
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_get_open_deposit_channels`

Return all deposit channels which have been opened and are relevant for `broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection`. Only returns bitcoin channels.

Parameters:
- `query`: Which deposit channels to take into account. Possible values are `Mine` and `All`.

Return:
- All currently open bitcoin deposit channels that match `query`.

Example input:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \

      },
      {
        "Taproot": [ ... ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_subscribe_transaction_screening_events`

Subscribe to all runtime events related to screening of transactions.

### `broker_open_private_btc_channel`

As a broker, you can open a private Bitcoin deposit channel that will not expire. Only one channel per broker is allowed.
A small amount of $Flip will be required to open the channel and held as bond until the channel is closed.
The private channel is used to receive [Bitcoin Vault Swaps](../advanced/vault-swaps/bitcoin.mdx) without the need to open a new channel for each swap.
Once open, use the `broker_request_swap_parameter_encoding` method to get the data needed to built the vault swap transaction to be send to the private channel.

Parameters: None

Return: The channel ID (Number)

### `broker_close_private_btc_channel`

Close the private Bitcoin deposit channel. The bond will be returned to your free balance.

Parameters: None

Return: The channel ID (Number)

### `broker_register_affiliate`

Register the given account as an affiliate to your broker account, assigning them the given short ID or auto assigning one if not provided.
An affiliate must be registered this way before they can be used in the `broker_request_swap_parameter_encoding` method.
If the given short ID is already in use, it will be overwritten with the given account and the existing affiliate will no longer be assigned that short ID.
If no short ID is provided and the affiliate is already registered, the existing short ID will be returned.

Parameters: 
- `affiliate_id`: The account ID of the affiliate broker.
- `short_id`: (Optional) The short ID to assign to the affiliate broker. A number between 0-255.

Return: The short ID assigned to the affiliate broker.

### `broker_get_affiliates`

Get a list of all affiliates registered to your broker account.

Parameters: None

Return: Array of registered short ID's and matching affiliate accounts `[[<ShortId>, <AccountId>]]`.

## Working Example

<Callout type="info">
  This example assumes the node that is exposing the Statechain RPC's is **funded**.
</Callout>

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash copy
RUST_LOG=info chainflip-broker-api \
    --state_chain.ws_endpoint=ws://localhost:9944 \
    --state_chain.signing_key_file /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file \
    --port 62378 # or whatever port you want to use
```

It will print `🎙 Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:62378.` and continue to run.

2. Open another terminal and run:

Register as a broker if you are not already.
```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost:62378/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_register_account"}'
```

3. Request a swap deposit address:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost:62378/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_request_swap_deposit_address", "params": ["ETH", "FLIP","0xabababababababababababababababababababab", 0]}'
```
The result is the hex encoded deposit address, channel id, expiry block, and the issued block:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "result":{
        "address":"0xe720e23f62efc931d465a9d16ca303d72ad6c0bc",
        "issued_block":5418,
        "channel_id":6,
        "source_chain_expiry_block":2954
    },
    "id":1
}
```

## Limitations

- The current API architecture supports only **`ws`** and not **`wss`**.

## Reference

### Assets

Assets are specified as a `{ chain, asset }` object, where the [chain](#chains) is as described below, and the asset is an upper-case string.

Assets returned from the RPCs will always take the explicit form, for example `{ chain: "Ethereum", asset: "ETH" }`

### Chains

Chains are specified as the full name of the chain, capitalized, for example `"Ethereum"`, `"Bitcoin"`, "`Polkadot"`.

### Addresses

Addresses should be encoded according to their host chains:
- Ethereum addresses should be encoded as Hex strings, for example `"0xfa36e03defc6e4d140cc61fcaab9d1fbef18642f"`.
- Polkadot addresses can be encoded using SS58 or Hex strings, for example: `"13zyEWmmLDx63Y99TL9SkxBe1DqPVCrcjXytxM3ZHGRyEJV5"` or `"0x84aec0876dbb3cb7391eeded2eef5fbcf0d1a34f7c9f86f9af205f944b461761"`
- Bitcoin addresses should be encoded using the appropriate bitcoin standard for the address type. For example `"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx"` is a valid bech32 address on Bitcoin testnet.
- Solana addresses can be encoded using bs58 or Hex strings: `"9acHwMGmeoMr5o8Cw1V2U4HjMQwhced3eQP31yYEhYDU"` or `"0x7f799121d6c125f312c5f423a51959ce1d41df06af977e9a17f48b2c82ecf89f"`

### Price

A 256 bit unsigned fixed point number, with 128 fractional bits, representing a price as the amount of quote asset a single unit of the base asset is valued at. Note the amounts are in the smallest units of both assets.
