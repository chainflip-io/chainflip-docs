# Broker API

The Broker API is a standalone client that exposes _Broker_ functionality via a JSON API interface. It can be obtained from the same location as the chainflip-node, i.e. you can install it via `apt`, use the provided docker image or compile it yourself from the sources on Github.

Brokers need to run the client for the API themselves, as the Broker holds keys used to sign extrinsics and collect any fees set for [Deposit Channels](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers). The API client works by pointing it to an RPC node — also run by the same Broker, ideally.

## 1. Running Broker API locally

Before you do anything, you need to generate a valid [signing_key](../chainflip-account/creating) and [fund](../chainflip-account/funding) the associated account.
If you are planning to use [our Docker setup](#option-b-running-the-broker-api-with-docker-compose), instructions on how to generate new keys and fund your account are provided in the github repo.

### Option A: Using the pre-compiled binaries

Download the `chainflip-broker-api` software and the `chainflip-node`:

```bash copy
apt-get install chainflip-broker-api
apt-get install chainflip-node
```

Generate a new signing key:

```bash copy
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/chainflip-cli chainfliplabs/chainflip-cli:berghain-1.6.7 generate-keys --json > broker-keys.json

mkdir -p /etc/chainflip/keys
cat broker-keys.json | jq -r '.signing_account_id' > /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

For a full list of command line arguments, see `chainflip-broker-api --help` and `chainflip-node --help`.

To use the default configuration, run:

- Testnet
```bash copy
chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/perseverance.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe --sync=warp

chainflip-broker-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure the signing key file is not exposed. Access to this key gives full control over the Broker account.
</Callout>

- Mainnet
```bash copy
chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/berghain.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe --sync=warp

chainflip-broker-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid exposing the broker-api publicly with these settings, as anyone could redeem your earned fees!
</Callout>

### Option B: Running the Broker API with Docker Compose

Alternatively, for a quick start with the Broker API, we have provided a docker-compose setup that runs the Broker API and a State Chain node (required).

- [Perseverance Testnet Setup](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-perseverance)
- [Mainnet Setup](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-mainnet-apis)

### Option C: Running the Broker API in Kubernetes

Chainflip maintains a helm chart for running the Broker API in Kubernetes.

- [Broker API Helm Chart](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/broker-api)

This setup requires a running instance of the State Chain (`chainflip-node`). You can use this helm chart to deploy the Broker API and the State Chain in the same Kubernetes cluster.

- [Node Helm Chart](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/node)

## 2. Registering the account

After being funded, before you can fully interact with the Broker API, your account needs to be [registered](#broker_register_account) as a Broker account.

### Command line arguments and defaults

- The `state_chain.ws_endpoint` should point at a **synced Chainflip State Chain RPC node**. The default is `ws://localhost:9944` — assuming it is run locally.
- The `state_chain.signing_key_file` should be a path to a file containing the hex-encoded **private key** for the on-chain Broker account. The default file path is `/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file`. The account should be [funded](/mainnet/validator-setup/funding-and-bidding#adding-funds-to-your-validator-node) and the account role should be set to Broker.
- The `port` is the port on which the Broker API will listen for connections. Use `0` to assign a random port. The default is `80`.
- New functionality available from version 1.7+: The `health_check.hostname` and `health_check.port` describe the hostname and port where the Broker API will listen for health check requests. Both arguments have to be specified for the health check server to start.

## 3. Using the Broker: RPC Methods

### `broker_request_swap_deposit_address`

Parameters:
- `source_asset`: Source [asset](#assets).
- `destination_asset`: Egress [asset](#assets).
- `destination_address`: Egress [Address](#addresses).
- `broker_commission`: Broker Commission in basis points (100th of a percent or 0.01%). Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint, and can be set at any value from 1 basis point to 1000 basis points (0.01% - 10%).
- `channel_metadata`: (Optional) [Cross-chain message](../advanced/cross-chain-messaging/cross-chain-messaging.mdx) metadata as a JSON object: `{"gas_budget": <hex_string>, "message":<hex_string>, "cf_parameters": <hex_string>}`. Where `gas_budget`, `message` and `cf_parameters` are hex encoded strings.
- `boost_fee`: (Optional) Maximum accepted boost fee in basis points (100th of a percent).
- `affiliate_fees`: (Optional) Array of affiliate brokers (up to 5) `[{"account": <AccountId>, "bps": <number>}]`.
- `refund_parameters`: (Optional) [Minimum accepted price](../../swapping-basics#minimum-accepted-price-slippage-protection) for swaps through the channel as JSON object: `{"retry_duration": <number>, "refund_address": <address>, "min_price": <hex_string>}`. Where `retry_duration` is a number of blocks, `refund_address` is an [address](#addresses), and `min_price` is a [price](#price).
- `dca_parameters`: (Optional) DCA parameters for swaps through the channel as JSON object: `{"number_of_chunks": <number>, "chunk_interval": <number>}`. Where `number_of_chunks` is the number of "sub-swaps" to perform, and `chunk_interval` is the delay between them in number of blocks.

Where every affiliate broker is defined as follow:
```json
{
	"account": <AccountId>,
	"bps": <BasisPoints>,
}
```
The total broker fee is the sum of the `broker_commission` + all the `affiliate_fees`.

Return:

- deposit [address](#addresses).

### `broker_register_account`

Parameters:

None

Return:

- `null` if successful, otherwise an error.

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_register_account"}' | jq
```

### `broker_withdraw_fees`

Withdraw all accumulated fees for a given asset.

Parameters:
- `asset`: The [asset](#assets) to withdraw.
- `destination_address`: The [destination address](#addresses) to which the assets should be withdrawn.

Return:
- tx_hash: Hash,
- egress_id: [ForeignChain, Number],
- egress_amount: Amount,
- egress_fee: Amount,
- destination_address: [Address](#addresses),

Example input:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_withdraw_fees", "params": {"asset": {"chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "ETH"}, "destination_address": "0xabababababababababababababababababababab"}}' | jq
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "tx_hash": "0x736c159fec96ea84b8eceb49258019625a17e68ab981a3a674261e1df00a0482",
    "egress_id": [

    "egress_fee": 490000,
    "destination_address": "0xabababababababababababababababababababab"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection`

Request an incoming transaction to be rejected. Only available for bitcoin. This call will always succeed, but the transaction will
only be refunded if it hasn't been witnessed on-chain yet. For unboosted channels this means prior to 6 blocks confirmation, for boosted 
channels its prior to 1 block confirmation, i.e. only while the transaction is in the mempool. Also, a broker can only mark transactions
going into its own deposit-channels for rejection.

Parameters:
- `tx_id`: The transaction id of the transaction to be rejected. Only bitcoin is supported, the transaction hash has to be specified as shown in
the example below. Also, note that the byte order of the hash is *in reverse* to the usual representation in bitcoin block explorers.

Return:
- Nothing if transaction was successfully marked for rejection, error message otherwise.

Example input:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection", "params": {"tx_id": {"Bitcoin": "0x736c159fec96ea84b8eceb49258019625a17e68ab981a3a674261e1df00a0482"}}}' | jq
```

Example output (success):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "null",
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_get_open_deposit_channels`

Return all deposit channels which have been opened and are relevant for `broker_mark_transaction_for_rejection`. Only returns bitcoin channels.

Parameters:
- `query`: Which deposit channels to take into account. Possible values are `Mine` and `All`.

Return:
- All currently open bitcoin deposit channels that match `query`.

Example input:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_get_open_deposit_channels", "params": {"query": "Mine"}}' | jq
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "btc_chain_accounts": [
      {
        "Taproot": [ ... ]
      },
      {
        "Taproot": [ ... ]
      },
      {
        "Taproot": [ ... ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### `broker_subscribe_transaction_screening_events`

Subscribe to all runtime events related to screening of transactions.

Parameters: None

Return:
- A websocket subscription for transaction screening events. It sends notifications about all screening events, i.e. not filtered by broker. 
  There are the following event types:
   - `TransactionRejectionRequestReceived`
   - `TransactionRejectedByBroker`
   - `TransactionRejectionRequestExpired`

Example input (the `websocat` utility is useful for testing websocket subscriptions):

```bash copy
websocat ws://localhost
{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_subscribe_transaction_screening_events"}
```

Example subscription message:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "broker_subscribe_transaction_screening_events",
  "params": {
    "subscription": 1667528407325164,
    "result": {
      "block_hash": "0xf3562acd35af86b19a1b8464ef589743b4482b36854f780f4b72199a0759e602",

            "tx_id": "0x8c985d3252aa7d02fade82c55e3423c583d09f544acf80c4116987ed3a5d8b7d"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### `broker_request_swap_parameter_encoding`

Create an encoded swap with the given parameters. The encoding depends on the chain of the input asset. 
The encoded data is then used to request a swap without opening a channel. See [Vault Swaps](../advanced/vault-swaps.mdx) for more details.

## Working Example

<Callout type="info">
  This example assumes the node that is exposing the Statechain RPC's is **funded**.
</Callout>

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash copy
RUST_LOG=info chainflip-broker-api \
    --state_chain.ws_endpoint=ws://localhost:9944 \
    --state_chain.signing_key_file /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file \
    --port 62378 # or whatever port you want to use
```

It will print `🎙 Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:62378.` and continue to run.

2. Open another terminal and run:

Register as a broker if you are not already.
```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost:62378/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_register_account"}'
```

3. Request a swap deposit address:

```bash copy
curl 'http://localhost:62378/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "broker_request_swap_deposit_address", "params": ["ETH", "FLIP","0xabababababababababababababababababababab", 0]}'
```
The result is the hex encoded deposit address, channel id, expiry block, and the issued block:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "result":{
        "address":"0xe720e23f62efc931d465a9d16ca303d72ad6c0bc",
        "issued_block":5418,
        "channel_id":6,
        "source_chain_expiry_block":2954
    },
    "id":1
}
```

## Limitations

- The current API architecture supports only **`ws`** and not **`wss`**.

## Reference

### Assets

Assets are specified as a `{ chain, asset }` object, where the [chain](#chains) is as described below, and the asset is an upper-case string.

Where the chain is unambiguous (for example for the native currencies), the asset can be submitted simply as the upper-case string.

For example, for BTC, `"BTC"` and `{ chain: "Bitcoin", asset: "BTC" }` are both valid and resolve to the same asset.

Assets returned from the RPCs will always take the explicit form, for example `{ chain: "Ethereum", asset: "ETH" }`

### Chains

Chains are specified as the full name of the chain, capitalised, for example `"Ethereum"`, `"Bitcoin"`, "`Polkadot"`.

### Addresses

Addresses should be encoded according to their host chains:
- Ethereum addresses should be encoded as Hex strings, for example `"0xfa36e03defc6e4d140cc61fcaab9d1fbef18642f"`.
- Polkadot addresses can be encoded using SS58 or Hex strings, for example: `"13zyEWmmLDx63Y99TL9SkxBe1DqPVCrcjXytxM3ZHGRyEJV5"` or `"0x84aec0876dbb3cb7391eeded2eef5fbcf0d1a34f7c9f86f9af205f944b461761"`
- Bitcoin addresses should be encoded using the appropriate bitcoin standard for the address type. For example `"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx"` is a valid bech32 address on Bitcoin testnet.

### Price

A 256 bit unsigned fixed point number, with 128 fractional bits, representing a price as the amount of quote asset a single unit of the base asset is valued at. Note the amounts are in the smallest units of both assets.
