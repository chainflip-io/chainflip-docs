# JavaScript SDK

<Callout type="warning">These docs are under active development as we iterate based on our partners' feedback</Callout>

The Chainflip SDK provides a simple way for JavaScript/TypeScript developers to interact with the Chainflip protocol. In this guide we'll explain how to:

1. **Get chains & assets**: Use the `getChains` and `getAssets` methods to retrieve information about the available chains and their respective assets.
2. **Get quotes**: The `getQuote` method provides a quote for a proposed swap. This includes the expected exchange rate, expected fees and expected duration.
3. **Swap assets:** There are two ways to initiate a swap on Chainflip:
   1. **Request a deposit address:** The `requestDepositAddress` method generates a deposit address on the source chain. The user sends funds to this address to initiate a swap.
   2. **Trigger a vault swap:** The `encodeVaultSwapData` method returns an unsigned transaction that encodes the details of the swap. The user signs and submits this transaction to initiate the swap.
4. **Get status:** The `getStatus` method provides real-time updates about the status of a swap operation.
