# Get required block confirmations

## getRequiredBlockConfirmations

Fetches the number of confirmations required by the protocol for each chain.

```typescript copy
export type ChainMap<T> = {
  Bitcoin: T;
  Ethereum: T;
  Polkadot: T;
};

class SwapSDK {
  getRequiredBlockConfirmations(): Promise<ChainMap<number | null>>;
}
```

Before a transaction to a deposit address or via smart contract call can be
considered confirmed, it must be included in a certain number of blocks to limit
the risk of a "reorg" event to the protocol. The number of blocks varies by chain. Some chains,
like Polkadot, have deterministic finality and do not require any confirmations
other than being included in a block. These chains will return `null` for the
number of confirmations required, while others will return a `number`.

### Example


```javascript
console.log(await swapSDK.getRequiredBlockConfirmations());
```

### Sample Response

```ts
{
  Bitcoin: 4,
  Ethereum: 7,
  Polkadot: null,
}
```
