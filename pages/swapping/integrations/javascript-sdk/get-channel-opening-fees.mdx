# Get channel opening fees

## getChannelOpeningFees

Returns the fee in Flipperino required to open a deposit channel for a chain.

```typescript copy
function getChannelOpeningFees(): Promise<ChainMap<bigint>>

type ChainMap<T> = {
  Bitcoin: T;
  Ethereum: T;
  Polkadot: T;
  Arbitrum: T;
  Solana: T;
};
```

When a broker opens a swap deposit channel, there is a fee that must be paid
from the \$FLIP balance of the account on the State Chain. The fee is measured in
Flipperino which is the smallest unit of \$FLIP (1 \$FLIP = 10^18 Flipperino).
This fee is determined per chain.

### Example


```typescript copy
console.log(await swapSDK.getChannelOpeningFees());
```

```typescript copy
// console output:
{
  Bitcoin: 0n,
  Ethereum: 0n,
  Polkadot: 0n,
  Arbitrum: 0n,
  Solana: 0n
}
```
