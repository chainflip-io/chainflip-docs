# Execute Swap

Alternatively, calling the `swap()` function in the Chainflip Vault contracts allows to initiate a swap immediately. The swap is then triggered without the need of a [Deposit Channel](request-deposit-address-v2.md) and therefore, no [Broker](../../running-a-broker/introduction) is necessary.

Using smart contract calls is **faster than requesting a deposit address** but also more expensive (more gas involved on approving token and amount allowance).

With this method, there's **no fixed period of time subject to expiration**.

  Trades](../../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers#vault-swaps)
  section.
</Callout>

## executeSwap()

<Callout type="error">
    This method was removed from the SDK because it is not incompatible with the protocol changes in version 1.8.

    As a replacement, you should use the [encodeVaultSwapData](../encode-vault-swap-data.md) method
    to get the unsigned transaction data for a swap.
    This data can be signed and submitted to the source chain with your preferred web3 library (eg ethers.js or viem).
</Callout>

Initiates a swap for the given parameters. For ERC-20 tokens, this method will request approval to use the tokens when the allowance is lower than the transfer amount.

```typescript copy
executeSwap(
  params: ExecuteSwapParams,
  txOpts: TransactionOptions = {},
): Promise<TransactionHash>
```

The `ExecuteSwapParams` has the following format:

```typescript copy
type ExecuteSwapParams = {
  srcChain: Chain;
  srcAsset: Asset;
  destChain: Chain;
  destAsset: Asset;
  destAddress: string;
  amount: string;
};
```

The `amount` param will always be in the **base unit of the source asset**, i.e. for `ETH` it will be **Wei**.<br/>If no `srcAsset` is provided, the source asset is native `ETH`.

The `TransactionOptions` allow to control the submitted transaction:

```typescript copy
type TransactionOptions = {
  gasLimit?: bigint;
  gasPrice?: bigint;
  maxFeePerGas?: bigint;
  maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint;
  nonce?: number;
  wait?: number; // number of confirmations before the method returns the transaction hash
};
```

### Example

```typescript copy
import { Chains, Assets } from "@chainflip/sdk/swap";

// Swaps 1 Ether for Bitcoin
const transactionHash = await swapSDK.executeSwap({
  amount: (1e18).toString(), // 1 ETH
  destChain: Chains.Bitcoin,
  destAsset: Assets.BTC,
  destAddress: "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa",
});
```

The resulting `transactionHash` can be used in [Get Status](../get-status.md).

## executeSwap() with Cross-Chain Message (CCM)

Additionally, the Chainflip vault smart contract has a `call()` function that allows passing an additional `message` property to the destination chain. This enables to [call a smart contract](../advanced/cross-chain-messaging.mdx) on the destination chain.

<Callout type="info">
  This enhanced composability allows any protocol to seamlessly integrate with
  Chainflip.
</Callout>

Initiates a swap for the given parameters and calls the destination address with the given `message`.

<Callout type="warning">
  For ERC-20 tokens, **make sure the token allowance is enough** to cover the
  transfer amount.
</Callout>

The `executeSwap` method can call this smart contract function when passed a `ccmParams` object with the rest of the `ExecuteSwapParams`.

```typescript copy
type ExecuteSwapParams = {
  srcChain: Chain;
  srcAsset: Asset;
  destChain: Chain;
  destAsset: Asset;
  destAddress: string;
  amount: string;
  ccmParams: {
      gasBudget: string;
      message: `0x${string}`;
  } | undefined;
};
```

The `amount` and `gasBudget` will always be in the **base unit of the source asset**, i.e. for `ETH` it will be **Wei**.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `message` param is a HEX-encoded sequence of bytes that should be passed
  with the swapped assets and should be shorter than 15k bytes.
</Callout>

### Message Receiver

Anyone looking to integrate Chainflip **must implement the Solidity function signature** below on the receiving contract address for EVM chains (see [EVM integration](../../advanced/vault-swaps#receive-call-and-asset-on-the-receiver-contract-ccm)) or the equivalent for Solana (see [Solana integration](../../advanced/cross-chain-messaging/sol-ccm.md#receive-call-and-asset-on-the-receiver-contract)).

```solidity
function cfReceive(
    uint32 srcChain,
    bytes calldata srcAddress,
    bytes calldata message,
    address token,
    uint256 amount
) external payable;
```
```rust
pub fn cf_receive_token<'c: 'info, 'info>(
    _ctx: Context<'_, '_, 'c, 'info, CfReceiveToken<'info>>,
    _source_chain: u32,
    _source_address: Vec<u8>,
    _message: Vec<u8>,
    _amount: u64,
) -> Result<()>;

pub fn cf_receive_native<'c: 'info, 'info>(
    _ctx: Context<'_, '_, 'c, 'info, CfReceiveNative<'info>>,
    _source_chain: u32,
    _source_address: Vec<u8>,
    _message: Vec<u8>,
    _amount: u64,
) -> Result<()>;
```

Additionally, in Solana all accounts accessed in a transaction need to be specified in an account list as described in [Solana considerations](../../advanced/cross-chain-messaging/sol-ccm.md#list-of-accounts).

<Callout type="warning">
If the receving address is not a contract or the contract call fails, the Chainflip protocol won't submit the transaction to the destination chain.

**This can lead to a loss of funds.**

</Callout>

### Example

This is how the `executeSwap()` function looks like with a cross chain message :

```typescript copy
import { Chains, Assets } from "@chainflip/sdk/swap";

// Swaps 1000 USDC for ETH and pass a message
const transactionHash = await sdk.executeSwap({
  amount: (1000e6).toString(), // 1000 USDC
  destChain: Chains.Ethereum,
  destAsset: Assets.ETH,
  srcAsset: Assets.USDC,
  destAddress: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
  ccmParams: {
    message: "0xdeadc0de", // should be shorter than 15k bytes
    gasBudget: (1e6).toString(), // 1 USDC will be swapped for ETH to pay for gas
  },
});
```

The resulting `transactionHash` can be used in [Get Status](../get-status.md).
