# Swap Assets

There are two ways to initiate a swap on Chainflip.
Both options are **fire-and-forget** - once the assets are sent to a deposit channel or the vault swap transaction is submitted, the user doesn't need to do anything for the swap to take place.

1. **Request a deposit address:** The [`requestDepositAddress` method](request-deposit-address-v2.md) generates a deposit address on the source chain.
The user sends funds to this address to initiate a swap.

2. **Trigger a vault swap:** The [`encodeVaultSwapData` method](encode-vault-swap-data.md) returns an unsigned transaction that encodes the details of the swap.
The user signs and submits this transaction to initiate the swap.

## Swap Features

The following features are supported by both, deposit channels and vault swaps:

### Slippage Protection: `fillOrKillParams`

The `fillOrKillParams` object sets two differnt types of slippage protection when initiating a swap.
1. [**minimum accepted price**](/swapping/swapping-basics#slippage-protection)
    This protects the swapper against price changes between a quote and the execution of a swap by setting a minimum accepted price.
    If the minimum price cannot be met with the available liquidity during the specified number of blocks,
    deposited assets will be refunded to the specified refund address.
2. [**live price protection**](/swapping/swapping-basics#slippage-protection)
    This protects the swapper against price changes between a quote and the execution of a swap by setting a maximum accepted deviation
    from the global index price of the asset. If the slippage tolerance is exceeded, the swap will be refunded to the specified refund address.
    This setting is especially useful during longer DCA swaps where the price of the asset is moving in favor of the swapper.
    i.e the slippage tolerance "follows" the global price of the asset. In case the price
    moves against the swapper, it will still execute as long as the execution price is above the minimum accepted price.

            The percentage of deviation from the global index price that is acceptable for the swap to execute. If the deviation is exceeded,
            the swap will be refunded to the specified refund address.
            If not set, the default value from the <code>quote</code> will be used. Set the value to <code>false</code> to disable live price protection.
            If the quote does not have a recommended live price slippage tolerance, this setting is not available for the asset pair and should not be set.

A slippage tolerance can be specified by using the `slippageTolerancePercent`
property. `slippageTolerancePercent` must be a number between 0 and 100. This
percent is used together with the `estimatedPrice` of the quote to calculate a
minimum accepted swap price:

```ts
const minimumPrice = quote.estimatedPrice * (1 - Number(slippageTolerancePercent) / 100);
```

<Callout type="warning">
    The slippage tolerance is applied relative to the
    <span className="font-bold">QUOTED</span> price and not the market or index rate.
    Prices are checked on the AMM level and do not include deposit or broadcast
    fees.
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can manually provide a `minPrice` value. The minimum price is
the ratio between the human readable destination amount and the human readable
source amount, e.g. `3500` for a swap from ETH to USDC if you want to receive after
least `3500` USDC per ETH.

Refunds are subject to a broadcast fee on the source chain to pay for the
transactions sent by the Chainflip protocol. The boost or deposit fee paid will
not be refunded.

#### Example

```typescript copy
const fillOrKillParams = {
  refundAddress: '0xa56A6be23b6Cf39D9448FF6e897C29c41c8fbDFF', // address to which assets are refunded
  retryDurationBlocks: 100, // 100 blocks * 6 seconds = 10 minutes before deposits are refunded
  slippageTolerancePercent: quote.recommendedSlippageTolerancePercent, // use recommended slippage tolerance from quote
  livePriceSlippageTolerancePercent: quote.recommendedLivePriceSlippageTolerancePercent, // use recommended live price slippage tolerance from quote
}
```

### Cross-Chain Messaging: `ccmParams`

The optional `ccmParams` object enables to pass a [Cross-Chain Message](../../advanced/cross-chain-messaging/cross-chain-messaging)
to a receiver contract/program on the destination chain.
