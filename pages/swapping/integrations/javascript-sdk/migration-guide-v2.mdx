# Migration guide (V2)

This document aims to capture the changes and highlight the differences introduced in `"@chainflip/sdk": "1.6.0"`
- [`getStatusV2()`](./get-status-v2.mdx)
- [`getQuoteV2()` ](./get-quote-v2.mdx)

These introduction of the new methods came as a result to  to support our latest feature DCA. see xxx


### GetStatusV2()
V2 introduces pretty significant changes to the structure of the response in addition to some renaming.

Previously, `getStatus()` returned a flat object with all the fields in the root of the response. This made for some really long property names that were not very readable. Now, we have them nested at different stages of the swap lifecycle. eg:


```typescript
{
  state: 'RECEIVING' | 'SWAPPING' | 'SENDING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED';
  "destAddress": "1yMmfLti1k3huRQM2c47WugwonQMqTvQ2GUFxnU7Pcs7xPo",
  "destAsset": "DOT",
  "destChain": "Polkadot",
  "estimatedDurationSeconds": 48,
  depositChannel: { ... }, // stage: 1
  deposit: { ... }, // stage: 2
  swap: { ... }, // stage: 3
  swapEgress: { ...} // stage: 4
  refundEgress: { ...} // stage: 4 (only if there is a full or partial refund)
}
```

Ensure that the property exists before accessing its children with
```ts
if('prop' in prop){
  // do something
}
```
We use helpers to acheive this. Here are some examples:

```typescript
const getEgressAmount = (response: SwapStatusResponseV2 | undefined) =>
  response && 'swapEgress' in response && response.swapEgress
    ? sdkStatus.swapEgress.amount
    : undefined;

const getSwapFailure = (response: SwapStatusResponseV2 | undefined) =>
  response &&
    'swapEgress' in response && response.swapEgress && 'failure' in response.swapEgress
      ? response.swapEgress.failure
      : undefined;

```

The biggest change v2 introduces is the possibility to have partial refunds due to DCA swaps. In V1, a swap could either be completed or refunded. In V2, a swap can be partially refunded. This means that the swap can be in a 'COMPLETED' state but still have a refund. This refund can be accessed in the `refundEgress` field of the response.
