# Available Roles

Chainflip uses the concept of Account Roles to manage permissions between various network actors. Every account on the Chainflip network can go through the lifecycle.

Upon [Funding](funding.mdx) your account, your account will be created without any defined role. This account state is known as `Unregistered`. Unregistered accounts have access to basic functionality on the State Chain, such as redeeming funds and participating in tokenholder governance.

In order to integrate in the network, you will need to **register** the account for the [Broker](broker.mdx) role.

When an account has fulfilled its purpose and the owner wishes to redeem all remaining FLIP tokens, its Role needs to be **deregistered** to ensure the account has cleaned up its state, for example withdrawing any assets held on-chain.
