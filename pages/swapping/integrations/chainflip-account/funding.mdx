# Funding

In order to use your Chainflip account, you need to fund it.

*Coming soon*

TODO: I would explain the various funding ways here: Auction dashboard, Smart Contract

## Fund and redeem via State Chain Gateway

As explained in the [State Chain Overview](../../../concepts/validator-network/state-chain-flip-gateway.md), the `StateChainGateway` contract has two main entry points for those looking to interact with the protocol:
1. Funding a State Chain account with \$FLIP tokens
2. Redeeming \$FLIP tokens from a State Chain account

### Funding a State Chain account

Users can fund a State Chain account by making a smart contract call and providing an amount of \$FLIP to be locked in the contract. Tokens need to be approved first by the user to be transferred by the contract.
