# Funding

In order to use your Chainflip account, you need to fund it.

## Fund and redeem via Auctions application

The easiest way to fund your Chainflip account is via the [Auctions application](https://auctions.chainflip.io/). This is primarily built for funding validator nodes, but can be used for any Chainflip account.

1. Make sure you have `FLIP` (ERC-20) in your EVM crypto wallet.
2. Go to [Chainflip Auctions page](https://auctions.chainflip.io/) > "[**My Nodes**](https://auctions.chainflip.io/nodes)".
3. Connect your crypto wallet containing the `FLIP`.
4. Click the button "**+ Add Node**" > You should see the "**Register new node**" dialog.
5. Enter the Validator ID you got during [Generating Keys](/mainnet/validator-setup/keys#validator-keys) step — your `Public Key(SS58)`— and the amount of `FLIP` you want to fund. Click on "**Add Funds**".
6. Your crypto wallet will ask you to sign two transactions. The first one is a token approval and the second one transfers and add funds to your account.
7. Congratulations! Your Chainflip account is now funded.

## Fund and redeem via State Chain Gateway

As explained in the [State Chain Overview](../../../concepts/validator-network/state-chain-flip-gateway.md), the `StateChainGateway` contract has two main entry points for those looking to interact with the protocol:
1. Funding a State Chain account with \$FLIP tokens
2. Redeeming \$FLIP tokens from a State Chain account

### Funding a State Chain account

Users can fund a State Chain account by making a smart contract call and providing an amount of \$FLIP to be locked in the contract. Tokens need to be approved first by the user to be transferred by the contract.
