# Broker Role

Brokers forward users' swap requests to the network, paying transaction fees on their behalf and potentially taking a commission for each swap. Successful brokers need to provide and market a swapping interface and ensure they are resistant to spam attacks. See our section on [brokers](../running-a-broker/introduction) for further information.

Brokers need to **register** their account for the Broker role to gain access to swap-related functionality.

```bash copy
chainflip-cli broker register
```

Once registered, the account will have full access to broker-related actions through the [Broker API](../running-a-broker/broker-api).

{/*TODO: Add a link to quick start Broker*/}

In order to be able to redeem all remaining FLIP, Broker accounts must **deregister**. As a pre-requisite for de-registering, Brokers must ensure they have withdrawn all of their earned commission fees. Once this is done, the Broker API can be switched off and the account deregistered via the CLI:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli broker deregister
```
