# How Swapping Works

At a high level, the process can be described with the following steps:

1. **Initiating a swap:** This first step can be done through the [Swapping app](https://swap.chainflip.io/) (frontend), the [Javascript SDK](integrations/javascript-sdk/introduction), or directly using the [Chainflip CLI client](integrations/running-a-broker/broker-api#broker_request_swap_deposit_address). There are two primary methods to start a Chainflip Swap:
  - **Generating a Deposit Address**: This method involves creating a unique deposit address where the user can send the funds. Once the deposit is made, the swap process is automatically triggered. See [Request Deposit Address](integrations/javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address-v2.md) method.
  - **Direct call to the Chainflip Vault:** This method is a function call to a smart contract for EVM chains and a program call to a program for Solana, including a payload. This makes *aggregation* easier for application developers (think DEX Aggregators). For more details see [Vault swaps](integrations/advanced/vault-swaps/vault-swaps).
2. **Witnessing the deposit:** The Validator network will monitor open [Deposit Channels](../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers) for incoming transactions and Vault Contracts for swap calls. Upon seeing a deposit for a Swap, it will be witnessed and registered on the State Chain.

<Callout type="warning">
  There's a delay between the deposit transaction and its confirmation on the
  State Chain. On Ethereum, is 7 blocks (\~84 seconds), whereas Bitcoin is 3
  blocks (\~30 minutes).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  At this point, you can use the [Block
  Explorer](https://scan.chainflip.io/swaps) to see the swap '_in
  progress_'.
</Callout>

3. **Processing the swap:** Once the swap is Witnessed it is ready to be swapped in the [Just-In-Time AMM](../../concepts/swaps-amm/just-in-time-amm-protocol) protocol. Swaps are automatically bundled and processed so that LPs can bid on swaps in the same block where they occur.\
   For swap routes that require more than one pool, i.e. BTC -> ETH, **each swap is conducted sequentially, usually in the same block:** BTC -> USDC, and then USDC -> ETH.

<Callout type="info">
  The swap input is first denominated in USD during the swapping process as a
  function of Chainflip's [$USDC Denominated
  Pools](../../concepts/swaps-amm/usdusdc-denominated-pools).
</Callout>

4. **Broadcasting the swap output:** Swapped assets on the State Chain are now listed as Pending Egress Transactions before being paid out to the user's destination address. These transactions are processed in a batch with estimated gas fees deducted to compensate the network for the [Broadcast](../../concepts/validator-network/egress-broadcasting-funds#broadcasting).
