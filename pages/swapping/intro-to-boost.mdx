# Introduction to Boost

## What is Boost?

*Boost* is an exciting new feature designed to speed up the swap times on Chainflip, making your swapping experience faster and more efficient.
A major pain-point for users is how slow deposits can be, particularly for chains such as Bitcoin where the deposits can take 30+ minutes to finalise due to the protocol's [safety margin](../concepts/validator-network/ingress-witnessing-deposits#the-witness-process). 
The safety margin is there to protect the protocol's liquidity from re-orgs and ensure that transactions are securely confirmed to avoid potential deficits. 

The *Boost* feature provides a solution to dramatically reduce these wait times without increasing the protocol’s risk.

## How does Boost work?

When a user wants to swap from Bitcoin, for example, can opt-in to *Boost* the deposit to speed up the overall swap time for fee.

| Swaps | Regular (worse) | Regular (best) | Boosted (worse) | Boosted (best) | Savings (AVG) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BTC → ETH | ~30.5 min | ~20.5 min | ~10.5 min | ~0.5 min | ~20 min |
| BTC → DOT | ~30.4 min | ~20.4 min | ~10.4 min | ~0.4 min | ~20 min |
| BTC → ARB | ~30.4 min | ~20.4 min | ~10.4 min | ~0.4 min | ~20 min |
| ETH → BTC | ~11.7 min | ~11.5 min | ~10.5 min | ~10.3 min | ~1 min |
| ETH → DOT | ~1.8 min | ~1.6 min | ~0.6 min | ~0.4 min | ~1.2 min |
| ETH → ARB | ~1.7 min | ~1.5 min | ~0.5 min | ~0.3 min | ~1.2 min |
| ETH → ETH | ~1.9 min | ~1.7 min | ~0.7 min | ~0.5 min | ~1.2 min |


The basic idea is to allow Liquidity Providers (LPs) to place collateral in shared *Boost* pools to be used as collateral for incoming deposits.

When *Boost* is enabled, a deposit is pre-witnessed (i.e. recognized by a majority of validators as having
been included in a block on the source chain), by checking that there is enough collateral in
the *Boost* pools.

If there is, this collateral will be used in place of the deposit (minus a *Boost* fee), allowing the 
swap to be executed early.

The LPs take the risk on that deposit being confirmed at a later point once the safety margin
has been reached.

### Example: Boost BTC to ETH swap

1. A user states the intention to swap a given amount of BTC to ETH with *Boost* feature enabled
2. The protocol [opens a *boosteable* Swap Deposit Channel](../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers#opening-deposit-channels) and generates a Bitcoin deposit address
3. The user sends the desired amount of BTC to the generated deposit address
4. The protocol attempts to [*Boost* the incoming deposit](../lp/boost/how-boost-works#boosting-a-deposit), by checking the available *Boost* liquidity provided by LPs
5. If there is enough collateral in the *Boost* pools, the protocol boosts the deposit **after it has been included in a block (pre-witnessed)**, deducting a small *Boost* fee from the total deposited amount
6. As soon as the deposit is pre-witnessed and boosted, the swap is triggered by the [JIT AMM](../concepts/swaps-amm/just-in-time-amm-protocol), and [sends the resulting ETH](../concepts/validator-network/egress-broadcasting-funds) to the destination address
7. The user receives ETH, saving ±20 minutes of total swap time

<Callout type="warning">
If there isn't enough collateral in the *Boost* pools, the protocol defaults to witness the deposit with regular block confirmations and **no *Boost* fee is applied**.
</Callout>

## Considerations

- The protocol will attempt to Boost *any* amount sent after one block confirmation, if Boost liquidity is available.
- Boosted deposits are binary — either the entire amount is boosted, or it defaults to a regular block confirmation time
- There are different Boost pools with different fees. The protocol will [take liquidity from the lowest fee pool to the highest](../lp/boost/how-boost-works#example), resulting in an average final Boost fee.
- The protocol will only attempt to boost a *second* deposit if the first deposit has been [finalised](../concepts/validator-network/ingress-witnessing-deposits#the-witness-process).
