# Introduction

## Swapping Documentation

Welcome to the Chainflip Swapping Documentation. Our goal with this documentation is to enhance your Developer Experience in three key ways:

1. **Educate:** We aim to familiarize developers with the fundamental concepts of the Chainflip Protocol.
2. **Enable Integration:** Our documentation provides detailed instructions, practical code examples, and best practices for integrating the Chainflip Protocol into your projects using our JavaScript SDK and API bundles. We cover everything from setting up your development environment to handling responses and errors.
3. **Support Development:** We offer comprehensive troubleshooting guides, FAQ sections, and additional resources to help you efficiently overcome any challenges you might encounter during the integration process. We also provide support channels for further assistance.

Whether you're looking to integrate cross-chain swapping functionality, enable liquidity provision, or simply explore the potential of the Chainflip Protocol, this guide will serve as a valuable resource.

## Swapping and Aggregation

Chainflip's swapping functionality enables users to seamlessly swap assets across different chains and networks. Despite the complexity behind the scenes, the swap process provides a smooth and efficient experience for the end user.

If you're interested in building a cross-chain swapping experience, start with our [Swapping Basics](swapping-basics.mdx) docs. You'll find everything you need to integrate Chainflip into your own application.

Aggregation, in this context, involves combining multiple protocols for a route from asset A to asset B. This is made possible thanks to our [Cross-Chain Messaging (CCM)](integrations/cross-chain-messaging.mdx) feature, which allows partners to easily integrate with the Chainflip protocol. See our [How Swapping Works](swapping-and-aggregation/how-swapping-works.md) to learn how it's done.
