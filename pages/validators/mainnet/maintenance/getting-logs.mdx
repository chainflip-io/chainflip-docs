# Getting Logs

We use [`journald`](https://sagan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/journald.html), which is systemd default log management service, to collect logs generated by the node and the engine. To interact with it, you'll use `journalctl`. Below are some useful commands when debugging your validator node.

## Journalctl 101

### Getting all logs for unit

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-node.service
```

This will output all logs generated by that unit. You hit `space` to scroll through the logs from older to newer.

### Following logs

If you want to see logs in real time, run the following:

```bash copy
journalctl -f -u chainflip-node.service
```

### Using time ranges

To filter your logs using time ranges you can run the following:

#### Relative time range

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-node.service --since "1 hour ago"
```

#### Specific time ranges

```bash copy
journalctl -u chainflip-node.service --since "2023-06-20 23:15:00" --until "2023-06-20 23:25:00"
```

## Setting Log Levels

Most of the time it is ok to just use the default log levels. However, these can be changed, either via environment variable, or dynamically.

### Environment Variable Log Level Changes

The `RUST_LOG` environment variable controls the initial filtering directives if specified at engine startup.

For example:

```bash copy
export RUST_LOG="debug,warp=off,hyper=off,jsonrpc=off,web3=off,reqwest=off"
```

### Dynamic Log Level Changes

Returns the current filtering directives:

```bash copy
curl -X GET 127.0.0.1:36079/tracing
```

> Note: The port used by the engine to accept these queries can be configured in your [`Settings.toml` file](../validator-setup/engine-settings.mdx).

Sets the filter directives so the default is DEBUG, and the logging in modules warp, hyper, jsonrpc, web3, and reqwest is turned off:

```bash copy
curl --json '"debug,warp=off,hyper=off,jsonrpc=off,web3=off,reqwest=off"' 127.0.0.1:36079/tracing
```

Equivalent to the above, but without using the --json short-hand:

```bash copy
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '"debug,warp=off,hyper=off,jsonrpc=off,web3=off,reqwest=off"' 127.0.0.1:36079/tracing
```

The syntax for specifying filtering directives is given [here](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html).
