# Engine Settings

We need to create the engine config file.

```shell copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/chainflip/config
sudo nano /etc/chainflip/config/Settings.toml
```

## Editing the Config

Copy the following to your `nano` editor. You also need to replace `PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE` with the public IP Address of your server. To get the public IP of your node you can run this command: `curl -w "\n" ifconfig.me`.&#x20;

Also you'll need to provide the `ws_endpoint`, and `http_endpoint` for whichever `Ethereum`, `Arbitrum`, `Polkadot` and `Bitcoin` RPC client you've selected.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure that both endpoints (HTTP and WebSockets) are accessible for the Ethereum, Arbitrum and Polkadot nodes. Bitcoin only has HTTP. Otherwise your engine will fail to start.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Note that you can optionally provide a backup RPC endpoint for each chain. If
  the primary endpoint fails, the engine will attempt to connect to the backup
  endpoint. The engine will only attempt to use the backup endpoint if the
  primary endpoint fails. You should set your primary endpoint to the cheapest
  (and most reliable) endpoint you have i.e. a local ETH node to lower
  your operating costs.

<Callout type="warning">
At least one of the RPC endpoints (primary or backup) *must* be an archive node.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Make sure that you are using a mainnet RPC, otherwise this will not work!
</Callout>

## Saving the File

Once you're happy with your configuration file and have inserted a valid endpoint address, exit and save the file by using `CTRL(Control)+x` and when prompted type `Y` then hit `Enter`.
