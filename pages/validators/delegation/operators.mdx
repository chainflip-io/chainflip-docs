# Operators

An Operator account is an entity that manages a set of one or more Validators. The main reason for creating an Operator account is that it enables your managed Validators to benefit from delegated bids.

The Operator determines the delegation fee that is levied on delegated funds, and has the power to block or allow specific delegators.

## Operator Settings and Interactions

Most of the following functionality is accessible via the (Operator App)[TODO].

Operators manage some settings related to delegation:

- `fee_bps`: `integer`
    This is the fee that will be taken from teh delegators' share of rewards, measured in basis points (0.01%).
- `delegation_acceptance`: `Allow` | `Deny`
    This determines if delegation is allowed or denied by default. If set to `Deny`, then delegators must explicitly be `allow`ed. If set to `Allow`, then delegators can can delegate freely unless they are `block`ed.

Furthermore, Operators have exclusive access to the following extrinsics:

- `claim_validator`: for claiming Validator accounts to be managed.
- `block_delegator`:
    When defaulting to `Allow`, adds the operator the blocklist.
    When defaulting to `Deny`, removes the operator from the allowlist.
- `allow_delegator`:
    When defaulting to `Deny`, adds the operator the allowlist.
    When defaulting to `Allow`, removes the operator from the blocklist.
- `deregister_as_operator`: Allows the operator to deregister and reclaim any remaining $FLIP in their account.

<Callout type="info">
In order to `block` or `allow` an account, it must exist on the State Chain!
</Callout>

## Setting Up

1. Create and Fund a new State Chain Account.
2. Register the account as an Operator:
    - set your preferred commission, subject to a minimum rate (15% at the time of writing).
    - set your default acceptance: either `deny` or `accept`.
3. `Claim` your Validators. The claimed account must be a registered Validator.
4.
    Each Validator now must accept the Operator's claim by submitting the `accept_operator` extrinsic. This can be done using the `chainflip-cli` on the Validator node:

    ```sh
    chainflip-cli validator accept-operator <OPERATOR_ID>
    ```
