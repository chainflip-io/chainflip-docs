# Delegation

Validators can accept [delegated FLIP](./../../concepts/validator-network/delegation) to increase their chances of winning Authority slots during the [Auction](./../../concepts/validator-network/validator-auctions-bonds-and-rewards).

In order to start benefitting from delegated stake, a Validator must be linked to an [Operator](./operators).
