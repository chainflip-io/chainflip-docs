# Running an RPC node

Running an RPC node for Chainflip is a relatively simple process. Our `apt` repository comes with pre-configured `systemd`
services that can be used to start an RPC node on your server. If you're using Docker or Kubernetes, we have pre-built images available on Docker Hub.

## Server Requirements

To run an RPC node, you need a server with the following minimum requirements:

- **CPU**: 4 cores
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **Storage**: 300 GB SSD (Current growth rate is around 25Gb per month)
- **Network**: 1 Gbps
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)

## Prerequisites
It's a good practice to use a fresh node and upgrade all system dependencies before installing the validator software.

```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Adding Chainflip's `apt` Repo

We distribute our binaries as debian packages through our `apt` repository. To install the packages, you need to add our repo to your `apt` sources list.

Use the following commands to add Chainflip's **Mainnet** `apt` repo to your node:

1. Download Chainflip Mainnet GPG key from the **Ubuntu Key Server** and update the file permissions to allow `apt` to read the key. Run the following command to download the key:

```bash copy
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-mainnet.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37
chmod 644 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-mainnet.gpg
```

2. Verify the key's authenticity:

```bash copy
gpg --export 4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37 | gpg --show-keys
```

<Callout type="warning">
    **Important:** Make sure you see the following output from the terminal:

    ```
    pub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [SC]
        4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37
    uid                      Chainflip Labs GmbH (Releaser Master Key) <security@chainflip.io>
    sub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [S] [expires: 2024-11-05]
    sub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [S] [expires: 2024-11-05]
    sub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [S] [expires: 2024-11-05]
    ```
</Callout>

3. Add Chainflip's Mainnet Repo to `apt` sources list:

<Callout type="info">
Mainnet binaries are compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). Running them on other versions of Ubuntu or other Debian-like distributions may require additional dependencies and configuration.
</Callout>

```bash copy
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-mainnet.gpg] https://pkgs.chainflip.io/ubuntu/ jammy berghain" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip-berghain-mainnet.list
```

## Installing The Packages

To install and run an RPC node, run the following commands:

```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y chainflip-node
```

As mentioned before, we ship the package with a pre-configured `systemd` service that can be used to start the RPC node on your server. To enable and start the service, run the following commands:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl enable chainflip-rpc-node
sudo systemctl start chainflip-rpc-node
```

Check that the node's status by running:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl status chainflip-rpc-node
```

You can check that the node is syncing by running:

```bash copy
sudo journalctl -u chainflip-rpc-node -f
```

and check the logs for the following:

```text
Nov 14 13:38:58 berghain-validator chainflip-node[1908]: 2023-11-14 13:38:58 ⏩ Warping, Downloading state, 7.02 Mib (4 peers), best: #0 (0x8b8c…6eb9), finalized #0 (0x8b8c…6eb9), ⬇ 372.3kiB/s ⬆ 0.2kiB/s
```

### Default Configuration

Our pre-configured RPC node is available as a debian package in our `apt` repository. We ship the package with the following default setup:

```
/usr/bin/chainflip-node \
    --base-path=/etc/chainflip/chaindata \
    --chain=/etc/chainflip/berghain.chainspec.json \
    --rpc-cors=all \
    --rpc-methods=unsafe \
    --unsafe-rpc-external \
    --max-runtime-instances=32 \
    --sync=warp
```

The command above sets up the RPC node:

1. In warp sync mode. This will sync the chain in a few minutes but not preserve any historical data. See [Setting up an Archive Node](#setting-up-an-archive-node) for more information.
2. With CORS enabled for all domains.
3. With unsafe RPC methods enabled.
4. With the RPC server listening on all interfaces.
5. Default state and block pruning settings. See [Configuring Pruning](#configuring-pruning) for more information.

### Modifying the Configuration
You can modify the configuration by editing the systemd service file by leverage `systemd` overrides. Using overrides means that future updates to the package won't overwrite your custom configuration.

```
sudo systemctl edit chainflip-rpc-node
```

From there you will be prompted to enter the configuration you want to override. For example, say you want to expose prometheus metrics, you can add the `--prometheus-external` flag:
Note: to change an `ExecStart` option, you need to clear the existing ExecStart option before adding the new one.

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/chainflip-node \
            --base-path=/etc/chainflip/chaindata \
            --chain=/etc/chainflip/berghain.chainspec.json \
            --rpc-cors=all \
            --rpc-methods=unsafe \
            --unsafe-rpc-external \
            --sync=warp \
            --max-runtime-instances=32 \
            --prometheus-external
```


### Configuring Pruning

In substrate-based chains, you can configure one or both of the state and block pruning settings to reduce the disk space usage of the node.

By default, the node will keep the last 256 blocks of state, and keep every finalized block. You can change these settings by modifying the `--state-pruning` and `--blocks-pruning` flags in the systemd service file.

This is taken straight from the help output of the `chainflip-node` binary:

```text
  --state-pruning <PRUNING_MODE>
      Specify the state pruning mode.

      This mode specifies when the block's state (ie, storage) should be pruned (ie, removed) from the database. This
      setting can only be set on the first creation of the database. Every subsequent run will load the pruning mode
      from the database and will error if the stored mode doesn't match this CLI value. It is fine to drop this CLI
      flag for subsequent runs. Possible values: - archive: Keep the state of all blocks. - 'archive-canonical' Keep
      only the state of finalized blocks. - number Keep the state of the last number of finalized blocks. [default:
      256]

  --blocks-pruning <PRUNING_MODE>
      Specify the blocks pruning mode.

      This mode specifies when the block's body (including justifications) should be pruned (ie, removed) from the
      database. Possible values: - 'archive' Keep all blocks. - 'archive-canonical' Keep only finalized blocks. -
      number Keep the last `number` of finalized blocks.
```

# Docker Installation

<Callout type="warning">
If you have done the **APT Installation** above, you don't need to follow the **Docker Installation** below.
</Callout>

If you are planning to run a validator using a container orchestration system like Kubernetes you can use our pre-built images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/chainfliplabs).

```bash copy
docker pull chainfliplabs/chainflip-node:berghain-1.3.2
```

## Starting up the node in Docker

Below is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file to start the node in Docker which works out of the box. Simply copy the contents below to a file named `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the node.

```yaml copy
version: "3.8"

services:
  node:
    image: chainfliplabs/chainflip-node:berghain-1.3.2
    container_name: chainflip-node
    pull_policy: always
    stop_grace_period: 5s
    stop_signal: SIGINT
    platform: linux/amd64
    restart: unless-stopped
    user: root
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9944:9944"
    volumes:
      - ./chainflip/chaindata:/etc/chainflip/chaindata
    entrypoint:
      - /usr/local/bin/chainflip-node
    command:
      - --base-path=/etc/chainflip/chaindata
      - --chain=/etc/chainflip/berghain.chainspec.json
      - --rpc-cors=all
      - --rpc-methods=unsafe
      - --unsafe-rpc-external
      - --sync=warp
```

To check the logs, run:

```bash copy
docker logs -f chainflip-node
```

NOTE: The `--sync=warp` flag is used to speed up the syncing process. You must remove it if you want to sync an Archive node (see [Setting up an Archive Node](#setting-up-an-archive-node)).

# Reverse Proxy Configuration

If you are running the node on a server and want to expose it to the internet, you can use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy to route traffic to the node.

You will need to generate an SSL certificate for your domain and configure the reverse proxy to route traffic to the node.

Below is an example configuration for Nginx:

```nginx copy
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name rpc.chainflip.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt; # Path to your SSL certificate
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key; # Path to your SSL certificate key

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; # Recommended TLS protocols
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem; # Diffie-Hellman parameter for DHE ciphersuites, recommended 2048 bits
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256';

    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9944; # Proxy pass to local backend on port 9944
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

# Setting up an Archive Node

If you require historical data, you can set up an archive node by removing the `--sync=warp` flag from the configuration. This will sync the chain from the genesis block and store all historical data.
We also have a pre-configured archive node package available in our `apt` repository. To install and run an archive node, run the following commands:

## Server Requirements

To run an RPC node, you need a server with the following minimum requirements:

- **CPU**: 4 cores
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **Storage**: 600 GB SSD (Current growth rate is around 45Gb per month)
- **Network**: 1 Gbps
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)

## Installing The Packages

If you've already downloaded the `chainflip-node` package, you can run the archive node package by running:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl enable chainflip-archive-node
sudo systemctl start chainflip-archive-node
sudo systemctl status chainflip-archive-node
```

Bear in mind that an archive node will take **significantly** longer to sync compared to an RPC node. You can check the logs by running:

```bash copy
sudo journalctl -u chainflip-archive-node -f
```
You should see the following in the logs:

```text
Apr 09 12:20:47 ubuntu-s-2vcpu-2gb-amd-fra1-01 chainflip-node[10677]: 2024-04-09 12:20:47 ⚙️  Syncing, target=#2123662 (9 peers), best: #1303 (0xb758…3296), finalized #1024 (0x7250…1fc2), ⬇ 665.0kiB/s ⬆ 24.4kiB/s
```
