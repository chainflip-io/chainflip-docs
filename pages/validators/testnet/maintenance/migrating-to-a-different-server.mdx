# Migrating to a Different Server

No problem, one of your amazing community members has developed this guide. After you have created a new machine and finished all the steps up to and including [Creating new linux users](../validator-setup/creating-new-linux-user), follow this guide.

## On Your New Machine

### Download Binaries via APT Repo

```bash copy
gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6
```

### Verify the key's authenticity

```bash copy
gpg --export BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6 | gpg --show-keys
```

<Callout type="warning">
    **Important:** Make sure you see the following output from the terminal:

    ```
    pub   rsa3072/0xFB3E88547C6B47C6 2022-11-08 [SC]
        Key fingerprint = BDBC 3CF5 8F62 3694 CD9E  3F5C FB3E 8854 7C6B 47C6
    uid                              Chainflip Labs GmbH <dev@chainflip.io>
    sub   rsa3072/0x48249A1599E31935 2022-11-08 [E]
    ```

</Callout>

### Add Chainflip's Repo to apt sources list

```bash copy
gpg --export BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6 | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-perseverance.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-perseverance.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/jammy jammy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
```

### Installing The Packages

```bash copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine
```

### Adding your existing keys

```bash copy
sudo mkdir /etc/chainflip/keys
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** After this you don't need to generate new Signing Keys, you can skip
  that phase and continue to the command below with your **old** Seed Secret.
</Callout>

### Recovering Your Keys

`THE_OLD_PHRASE` \<< change to your old phrase you have backed up.

```bash copy
chainflip-cli generate-keys \
    --path /etc/chainflip/keys \
    --seed-phrase 'THE_OLD_PHRASE'
```

<Callout type="info">
Please note that the `Node Key` cannot be recovered, a new one will be generated. This will result in a new peer id for your node.
</Callout>


### Back Them Up & Copy Your Validator ID

```bash copy
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
history -c
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to update your config file with the IP address of the new VPS.
  Otherwise you'll get slashed once you start the engine on the new VPS.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Do not run two instances of your Validator at the same time**. You will
  almost certainly be slashed. Make sure you turn off your old server before you
  turn on your new one.
</Callout>

After that make sure to stop the engine and the node on the old VPS by running:

### On the **<span style={{ color: "red"}}>**Old**</span>** VPS

```bash copy
sudo systemctl disable --now chainflip-node.service
sudo systemctl disable --now chainflip-engine.service
sudo apt purge chainflip-node
sudo apt purge chainflip-engine
```

### On the **<span style={{ color: "green"}}>**New**</span>** VPS

1. Setup the config file as explained in [Engine Settings](../validator-setup/engine-settings.md) section.
2. Then start the node and engine services as explained in [Start up](../validator-setup/starting-the-node.md) section.
