# Submitting an Issue

This is the official way to report an issue.

First output your logs to the terminal. Copy the output to the channel below.

```bash copy
journalctl -u "chainflip-*" --since "2 days ago" > /tmp/logs
```

Then you can very easily copy that log file to your local machine, and include it in your issue description in Discord.

```bash copy
scp -i /path/to/ssh/key root@<YOUR NODE IP>:/tmp/logs $HOME/
```

For general help, the [`ðŸ§ªï¸±testnet-discussion`](https://discord.com/channels/824147014140952596/1025410114875834408) channel in the **Perseverance Testnet** Discord category is a good place to start.\
