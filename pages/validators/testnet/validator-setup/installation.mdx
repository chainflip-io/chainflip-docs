# Getting the Validator Software

This guide describes how to download and run Chainflip's validator software.

## Download Binaries via APT Repo

Use the following commands to add Chainflip's APT Repo to your node then use `apt install` to get the binaries:

### Adding Chainflip APT Repo

Download Chainflip GPG key from our official repo:

```bash copy
gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6
```

Verify the key's authenticity:

```bash copy
gpg --export BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6 | gpg --show-keys
```

<Callout type="warning">
    **Important:** Make sure you see the following output from the terminal:

    ```
    pub   rsa3072/0xFB3E88547C6B47C6 2022-11-08 [SC]
        Key fingerprint = BDBC 3CF5 8F62 3694 CD9E  3F5C FB3E 8854 7C6B 47C6
    uid                              Chainflip Labs GmbH <dev@chainflip.io>
    sub   rsa3072/0x48249A1599E31935 2022-11-08 [E]
    ```

</Callout>

After that, add Chainflip's Repo to `apt` sources list:

```bash copy
gpg --export BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6 | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-perseverance.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-perseverance.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/jammy jammy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
```

#### Installing The Packages

```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine
```

#### Disable Automatic Updates
Automatic updates are generally a good idea for keeping your system secure and up to date. However, for a Chainflip binaries, it is recommended to disable automatic updates to avoid interrupting operations when an update has breaking changes that need coordination with the rest of the network.

```bash copy
sudo apt-mark hold chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine
```
