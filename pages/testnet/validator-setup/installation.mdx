# Getting the Validator Software

This guide describes how to download and run Chainflip's validator software.

## Download Binaries via APT Repo

Use the following commands to add Chainflip's APT Repo to your node then use `apt install` to get the binaries:

### Adding Chainflip APT Repo

Download Chainflip GPG key from our official repo:

```bash copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL repo.chainflip.io/keys/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

Verify the key's authenticity:

```bash copy
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

<Callout type="warning">
    **Important:** Make sure you see the following output from the terminal:

    ```
    pub rsa3072 2022-11-08 [SC] [expires: 2024-11-07]

    sub rsa3072 2022-11-08 [E] [expires: 2024-11-07]
    ```

</Callout>

After that, add Chainflip's Repo to `apt` sources list:

```bash copy
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/$(lsb_release -c -s) $(lsb_release -c -s) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
```

#### Installing The Packages
