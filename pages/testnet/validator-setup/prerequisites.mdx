# Prerequisites

This guide describes what you are going to need to successfully set a Chainflip validator node.

## EVM Chain Accounts

We highly advise **against** using a digital wallet that has any real funds in this setup. For the purposes of joining Chainflip's or any other testnet, it is a best-practice to create new wallets.

You'll need two Ethereum Accounts: the first one (we will refer to it as _**your**_ _**Wallet/Account**_) will be used for receiving `tFLIP` and Interacting with the Auctions App to add and redeem funds and the second one (we will refer to it as the _**Validator Wallet/Account**_) will be used by the validator to send transactions to the Sepolia Ethereum blockchain (this will be automatically generated as part of [Generating Keys](./keys.md)).

## EVM Chains Native Token

You validator will need to have a balance of the native token of the EVM chain you are validating on. For example, for Ethereum you will to have ETH, for Arbitrum you will need to have ArbETH and so on. The recommended amount is 0.1 of the native token on each chain. Each Validator is responsible for submitting transactions to the EVM blockchains supported by the protocol.

**Getting test assets**\
  `sETH` is Sepolia Ether and can be obtained from a Sepolia faucet. Faucets are not always reliable, so if you have an issue obtaining sETH, please message the Discord
  [`🙋︱help-and-support`](https://discord.com/channels/824147014140952596/824147718444023848) channel.

**Faucets:**

- [LearnWeb3 Faucet](https://learnweb3.io/faucets/sepolia/)
- [Sepolia PoW Faucet](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/)

You will need a way for your validator to monitor the Sepolia Ethereum Blockchain. The Chainflip Engine software allows you to use any endpoint you specify in its config file. You can either [run a geth client](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) (make sure to set this up on the Sepolia testnet!), or you can rely on a third-party remote client provider such as [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), or [Rivet](https://rivet.cloud/).

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note, gas cost reimbursements are currently not implemented for
  Validators. Validators will need to ensure their wallets are topped up with
  sETH or they may run out and be unable to broadcast on behalf of the network.
  This is a limitation of the Vault Contract design, however, automatic
  reimbursement is on the future feature list.

## System Requirements

Chainflip Validator machines are required to perform some computationally expensive tasks. A cheap VPS **will not** [cut the mustard](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/cut+the+mustard). We want to see how the network performs using a diverse set of machines, so we will not be offering too much in the way of suggestions in these docs, but Chainflip recommends a **minimum** of:

```
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04 | Our binaries are not compiled on any other OS
CPU: 4GHz+ amd64/x86_64 CPU Architecture | 4+ Dedicated Cores or 6+ Shared Cores
RAM: 8GB+
SSD: 100GB+ NVMe (this may increase over time)
Bandwidth: Minimum 400MBps, Recommended 1GBps connection, 100 GB bandwidth combined up/down per month
Provider: Any except Contabo. DO NOT USE CONTABO.
```

This machine must be available 24/7 and thus it is recommended that you only try this on machines with a stable and reliable internet connection, such as a VPS or Dedicated Server. If you would like some help picking a server to rent, you can come to the Chainflip Community Discord and ask for help in the [`🛠︱technical-discussion`](https://discord.com/channels/824147014140952596/824147608377098241) or the [`💬-node-support`](https://discord.com/channels/824147014140952596/1096065647361925161) channels.

### Firewall

You should ensure that all connections on ports `30333 (TCP)` and `8078 (TCP)` are not blocked! Some VPS providers enable an all-port firewall by default, but if this is not the case your node will not be able to participate in Keygen / Signing ceremonies and as a result will never become active.

Also, make sure your firewall allows NTP outbound traffic (Port 123 UDP).
