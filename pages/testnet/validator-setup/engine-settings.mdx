# Engine Settings

We need to create the engine config file.

```shell copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/chainflip/config
sudo nano /etc/chainflip/config/Settings.toml
```

## Editing the Config

Copy the following to your `nano` editor. You also need to replace `IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE` with the public IP Address of your server. To get the public IP of your node you can run this command: `curl -w "\n" ifconfig.me`.&#x20;

Also you'll need to provide the `ws_endpoint`, and `http_endpoint` for whichever [Ethereum client](#pointing-to-the-ethereum-client) you've selected. It will look different depending on which client you select:

- Rivet - `wss://SOME_LONG_SECRET_INFORMATION.sepolia.ws.rivet.cloud`
- Infura - `wss://sepolia.infura.io/ws/v3/SOME_LONG_SECRET_INFORMATION`
- Alchemy - `wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/SOME_LONG_SECRET_INFORMATION`

<Callout type="info">

Make sure that both endpoints (HTTP and WebSockets) are accessible for the Ethereum and Polkadot nodes. Bitcoin only has HTTP. Otherwise your engine will fail to start.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Note that you can optionally provide a backup RPC endpoint for each chain. If
  the primary endpoint fails, the engine will attempt to connect to the backup
  endpoint. The engine will only attempt to use the backup endpoint if the
  primary endpoint fails. You should set your primary endpoint to the cheapest
  (and most reliable) endpoint you have i.e. a local geth node to lower
  your operating costs.
</Callout>

```toml
# Default configurations for the CFE
[node_p2p]
node_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file"
ip_address = "IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE"
port = "8078"

[state_chain]
ws_endpoint = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944"
signing_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file"

[eth]
# Ethereum private key file path. This file should contain a hex-encoded private key.
private_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file"

[eth.rpc]
ws_endpoint = "wss://my_local_geth_node:8546"
http_endpoint = "https://my_local_geth_node:8545"

# Optional
# [eth.backup_rpc]
# ws_endpoint = "wss://some_public_rpc.com:443/<secret_access_key>"
# http_endpoint = "https://some_public_rpc.com:443/<secret_access_key>"

[dot.rpc]
ws_endpoint = "wss://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"
http_endpoint = "https://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"

# Optional
# [dot.backup_rpc]
# ws_endpoint = "wss://rpc-pdot2.chainflip.io:443"
# http_endpoint = "https://rpc-pdot2.chainflip.io:443"

[btc.rpc]
basic_auth_user = "flip"
basic_auth_password = "flip"
http_endpoint = "http://a108a82b574a640359e360cf66afd45d-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"

# Optional
# [btc.backup_rpc]
# basic_auth_user = "flip2"
# basic_auth_password = "flip2"
# http_endpoint = "http://second-node-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"

# Optional (default: 36079)
# [logging]
# command_server_port = 36079

```

<Callout type="warning">
At least one of the RPC endpoints (primary or backup) *must* be an archive node.
</Callout>

## Pointing to the Ethereum Client

If you followed the instructions in [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md), you will probably have an account with an Ethereum RPC provider (Alchemy, Infura, Rivet, etc.). You must change the `ws_endpoint` and `http_endpoint` in the above file to RPC URLs given to you by these services. You must have both a Websocket (wss) and HTTPS connection in order for the software to function.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Make sure that you are **not** using a mainnet RPC, this will not
  work!
</Callout>

You can try other node connections as well. [Geth with an open websocket server enabled](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server#websocket-server) will accept connections through port 8546 by default. If it's running on the same machine as your validator, you can use `[ws|http]://127.0.0.1:854[6|5]`

## Saving the File

Once you're happy with your configuration file and have inserted a valid endpoint address, exit and save the file by using `CTRL(Control)+x` and when prompted type `Y` then hit `Enter`.
