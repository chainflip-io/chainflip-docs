# Migrating to a Different Server

No problem, one of your amazing community members has developed this guide. After you have created a new machine and finished all the steps up to and including [Creating new linux users](../validator-setup/creating-new-linux-user), follow this guide.

## On Your New Machine

### Download Binaries via APT Repo

```bash copy
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL repo.chainflip.io/keys/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

### Verify the key's authenticity

```bash copy
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

### Add Chainflip's Repo to apt sources list

```bash copy
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/$(lsb_release -c -s) $(lsb_release -c -s) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
```

### Installing The Packages

```bash copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine
```

### Adding your existing keys

```bash copy
sudo mkdir /etc/chainflip/keys
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** After this you don't need to generate new Signing Keys, you can skip
  that phase and continue to the command below with your **old** Seed Secret.
</Callout>

### Loading Your Signing Keys

`YOUR_VALIDATOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` \<< change to Your private key from Metamask.

```bash copy
echo -n "YOUR_VALIDATOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY" | sudo tee /etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file
```

`YOUR_CHAINFLIP_SECRET_SEED` \<< change this text to the **old** Secret Seed

```bash copy
export SECRET_SEED=YOUR_CHAINFLIP_SECRET_SEED
```

```bash copy
echo -n "${SECRET_SEED:2}" | sudo tee /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

## Generating a Node Key

Finally, we need to do a similar process one more time. We need to generate a separate key that is used for secure communication between Validators. This time run:

```bash copy
sudo chainflip-node key generate-node-key --file /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
```

You can check that the command worked by running the following command:

```bash copy
cat /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
```

You should see the contents of the files printed to your terminal.

### Back Them Up & Copy Your Validator ID

```bash copy
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
history -c
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to update your config file with the IP address of the new VPS.
  Otherwise you'll get slashed once you start the engine on the new VPS.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Do not run two instances of your Validator at the same time**. You will
  almost certainly be slashed. Make sure you turn off your old server before you
  turn on your new one.
</Callout>

After that make sure to stop the engine and the node on the old VPS by running:

### On the **<span style={{ color: "red"}}>**Old**</span>** VPS

```bash copy
sudo systemctl stop chainflip-node.service
sudo systemctl stop chainflip-engine.service
sudo systemctl disable chainflip-node.service
sudo systemctl disable chainflip-engine.service
```

### On the **<span style={{ color: "green"}}>**New**</span>** VPS

1. Setup the config file as explained in [Engine Settings](../validator-setup/engine-settings.md) section.
2. Then start the node and engine services as explained in [Start up](../validator-setup/installation-pt2.md) section.
