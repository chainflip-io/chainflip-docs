# Working Example

## Running LP API locally

Before you do anything, you need to generate a valid `signing_key` and [fund](/perseverance/funding/funding-and-bidding) the associated account.

### Using the pre-compiled binaries

Download the lp-api software and the chainflip-node:

```bash copy
apt-get install chainflip-lp-api
apt-get install chainflip-node
```

For a full list of command line arguments, see `chainflip-lp-api --help` and `chainflip-node --help`.

To use the default configuration, run:

```bash copy
chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/perseverance.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe
chainflip-lp-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key_file
```

## Using Docker

We also publish testnet docker images. See the [chainflip-perseverance](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-perseverance) repo for full details.

## Registering the account

After being funded, before you can fully interact with the LP API, your account needs to be [registered](/integration/liquidity-provision/lp-api#lp_register_account) as a Liquidity Provider account.

## Deployment Schema

LPs (and Brokers) should ideally run their own local RPC nodes. These nodes connect to the network and expose the LP & Broker APIs locally to the backend they want to use.

  Avoid using the public RPC node since its particularly vulnerable to DDOS or
