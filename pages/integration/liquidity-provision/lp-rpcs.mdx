# Liquidity Provider / Market Maker RPCs

Here are the RPCs and subscriptions that are useful for liquidity providers.

## WebSocket subscriptions

Example usages are using a Websocket utility such as [Websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat):


### cf_subscribe_pool_price

Subscribes to the current price of a particular pool. This is useful for liquidity providers to see the current price of a pool.

It returns the price at the time of beginning the subscription as the first item in the stream. Subsequent items are only returned if there is a *change* in the price.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"cf_subscribe_pool_price","params":["Btc", "Eth"]}
```

## RPC requests

Example usages are using curl:

### cf_required_asset_ratio_for_range_order

Returns the ratio of assets that would be required to create a range order at the specified tick range.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"cf_required_asset_ratio_for_range_order","params":["Btc", "Eth", [0, 1000]]}
```

### cf_pool_info

Returns the fees percentages lps earn in the given pool.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"cf_pool_info","params":["Btc", "Eth"]}
```

### cf_pool_depth

Returns depth of a specified pool between two prices.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"cf_pool_depth","params":["Btc", "Eth", [0, 1000]]}
```

### cf_pool_liquidity

Returns all the liquidity available for swaps in a particular pool.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"cf_pool_liquidity","params":["Btc", "Eth"]}
```

### cf_pool_orders

Returns all the orders associated with a specified account in a particular pool.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"cf_pool_orders","params":["Btc", "Eth", "cFLdopvNB7LaiBbJoNdNC26e9Gc1FNJKFtvNZjAmXAAVnzCk4"]}
```

### cf_pool_range_order_liquidity_value

Returns the value of a hypothetical range order, e.g. the assets would would be returned to an LPs free balance if they were to close/cancel such a range order.

#### Example

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"cf_pool_range_order_liquidity_value","params":["Btc", "Eth", [0, 1000], 10000000]}
```
