# LP API

<Callout type="warning">These docs are under active development. ðŸš§</Callout>

The LP API bundle exposes a JSON API that allows liquidity providers to put up orders programmatically through the JIT AMM. It connects to a _State Chain_ node, and handles the complexities of submitting and monitoring extrinsics, allowing for simpler integration.

Please also see the [LP RPCs](lp-rpcs) documentation for information on RPCs and subscriptions exposed by the State Chain directly.

## Command line arguments

The `ws_endpoint` should point at a synced RPC node, the `signing_key_file` should be the **private key** for their on-chain account, and that account should already be [funded](../../../perseverance/funding/funding-and-bidding).

```bash copy
./chainflip-lp-api --help
```
```sh
chainflip-lp-api

USAGE:
    chainflip-lp-api [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --port <PORT>
            The port number on which the LP server will listen for connections. Use 0 to assign a
            random port. [default: 80]

        --state_chain.signing_key_file <SIGNING_KEY_FILE>
            A path to a file that contains the LPs secret key for signing extrinsics. 
            [default: /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file]

        --state_chain.ws_endpoint <WS_ENDPOINT>
            The state chain nodes RPC endpoint. [default: ws://localhost:9944]
    
    -v, --version 
            Print the version of the API
```

## RPC Parameters

Parameters can be encoded as a JSON array or as an object. The advantage of the latter is that it's more explicit and allows for optional values to be omitted.

### Addresses

Addresses should be encoded according to their host chains:
- Ethereum addresses should be encoded as Hex strings, for example `"0xfa36e03defc6e4d140cc61fcaab9d1fbef18642f"`.
- Polkadot addresses can be encoded using SS58 or Hex strings, for example: `"13zyEWmmLDx63Y99TL9SkxBe1DqPVCrcjXytxM3ZHGRyEJV5"` or `"0x84aec0876dbb3cb7391eeded2eef5fbcf0d1a34f7c9f86f9af205f944b461761"`
- Bitcoin addresses should be encoded using the appropriate bitcoin standard for the address type. For example `"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx"` is a valid bech32 address on Bitcoin testnet.

### Amounts

JSON only supports numbers up to 2^53. Since many tokens are represented as atomic amounts with 18 decimals, this corresponds for around 0.009 ETH!

Therefore, numbers denoting token amount or prices can be specified either as numbers or encoded as big-endian hex.

For example ETH uses 18 decimal places, so 100ETH is 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 Units. This can be only be encoded as a hex string: `"0x56bc75e2d63100000"`

Another example: USDC uses 6 decimals, so 10USDC is 10,000,000 Units. This fits in a JSON number: `10000000`.

### Assets

Assets are specified as a `{ chain, asset }` object, where the [chain](#chains) is as described below, and the asset is an upper-case string.

Where the chain is unambiguous (for example for the native currencies), the asset can be submitted simply as the upper-case string.

For example, for BTC, `"BTC"` and `{ chain: "Bitcoin", asset: "BTC" }` are both valid and resolve to the same asset.

Assets returned from the RPCs will always take the explicit form, for example `{ chain: "Ethereum", asset: "ETH" }`

### Chains

Chains are specified as the full name of the chain, capitalised, for example `"Ethereum"`, `"Bitcoin"`, "`Polkadot"`.

### Order IDs

Order IDs are interpreted as 64-bit integers and as such can be specified using a JSON number, up to `2^53`. Alteratively the ID can be encoded as a hex string, up to 8 bytes (16 hex characters) long.

Order IDs are assigned by the LP, are unique within each pool and for each account, and can be re-used.

### Order Updates

Changes in order size are communicated via an `increase_or_decrease` object which has this shape for range orders:

```json
{
  "increase": {
    "liquidity": <amount>,
    "amounts": {
      "base": <amount>,
      "pair": <amount>
    }
  }
}
// OR for a decrease:
{
  "decrease": {
    "liquidity": <amount>,
    "amounts": {
      "base": <amount>,
      "pair": <amount>
    }
  }
}
```

And this shape for limit orders:

```json
{
  "increase": <amount>
}
// OR for a decrease:
{
  "decrease": <amount>
}
```


## RPC Methods

- `null` if successful, otherwise an error.

### `lp_liquidity_deposit`

Parameters:

- [Asset](#asset-type) to be deposited.

Return:

- Encoded deposit [address](#foreign-chain-addresses) that you should send the deposit to.

#### Example

Request:

  ```

- Response
  ```json
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":["Ethereum",48],"id":1}
  ```

### `lp_update_range_order`

Parameters:

- `base_asset`: Base [Asset](#assets).
- `pair_asset`: Pair [Asset](#assets).
- `id`: Numerical [Order ID](#order-ids).
- `tick_range`: (Optional) A JSON array of two JSON Integers in the range [-887272, 887272], representing the lower and upper bound of the order's price range. If not specified, the previous tick range of this order id will be used.
- `size_change`: An `increase_or_decrease` JSON object specifying the change in order size, where `<increase_or_decrease>` is either "increase" or "decrease". There are two different ways to provide this:
  1. `{<increase_or_decrease>: {"Liquidity": {"liquidity": <liquidity>}}}` where `<liquidity>` is an [amount](#amounts) specifying the size of the order in microUSDC.
  2. `{<increase_or_decrease>: {"AssetAmounts":{"maximum":{"base": <amount>, "pair": <amount>}, "minimum":{"base": <amount>, "pair: <amount>}}}}` where the [`<amounts>`](#amounts) specify the size of the order in smallest units of the respective asset (base or pair), e.g. For Bitcoin it is in Satoshis. Using "AssetAmounts", the system will try to the change the order by an amount of assets between the specified maxima and minima, subject to available liquidity. If you would not like to change the size of the order you can specify zero values using either "Liquidity" or "AssetAmounts".

Return:

A chronological list of all the [updates](#order-updates) that were done as part of the operation. Each item in the list is a JSON object:

```json
  { 
    "base_asset:" <asset>,
    "pair_asset": <asset>,
    "id": <order_id>,
    "tick_range": [<tick>, <tick>], 
    "liquidity_total": <liquidity>, 
    "collected_fees": { "base": <amount> , "pair": <amount> }, 
    "size_change": { <increase_or_decrease>: {
      "liquidity": <liquidity>,
      "amounts": {"base": <amount>, "pair": <amount>}
      }
    }
  }
```

For example if a `lp_update_range_order` request moves an existing range order to a new tick_range, the return would contain two of these, one for the decrease to zero/destruction of the order at the previous tick range, and then one for the increase/creation of the order at the new tick range.

### `lp_set_range_order`

Parameters:

- `base_asset`: Base [Asset](#assets).
- `pair_asset`: Pair [Asset](#assets).
- `id`: Numerical [Order ID](#order-ids).
- `tick_range`: (Optional) A JSON array of two integers in the range [-887272, 887272], representing the lower and upper bound of the order's price range. If not specified, the previous tick range of this order id will be used.
- `size`: A JSON object specifying the order size. There are two different ways to provide this:
  1. `{"Liquidity": {"liquidity": <liquidity>}}` where `<liquidity>` is an [amount](#amounts) specifying the size of the order in microUSDC.
  2. `{"AssetAmounts":{"maximum":{"base": <amount>, "pair": <amount>}, "minimum":{"base": <amount>, "pair: <amount>}}}` where the [`<amounts>`](#amounts) specify the size of the order in smallest units of the respective asset (base or pair), e.g. For Bitcoin it is in Satoshis. Using "AssetAmounts", the system will try to set the order size to an amount of assets between the specified maxima and minima, subject to available liquidity.

Return:

A chronological list of all the [updates](#order-updates) that were done as part of the operation. Each item in the list is a JSON object:

```json
  { 
    "base_asset:" <asset>,
    "pair_asset": <asset>,
    "id": <order_id>,
    "tick_range": [<tick>, <tick>], 
    "liquidity_total": <liquidity>, 
    "collected_fees": { "base": <amount> , "pair": <amount> }, 
    "size_change": { <increase_or_decrease>: {
      "liquidity": <liquidity>,
      "amounts": {"base": <amount>, "pair": <amount>}
      }
    }
  }
```

For example if a `lp_set_range_order` request changes the total size of an existing range order, the return would contain two of these, one for the decrease to zero/destruction of the previous order, and then one for the increase/creation of the order with the new size.

### `lp_update_limit_order`

Update a limit order by increasing or decreasing its size.

Parameters:

- `sell_asset`: Sell [Asset](#assets).
- `buy_asset`: Buy [Asset](#assets).
- `id`: Numerical [Order ID](#order-ids).
- `tick`: (Optional) Price tick in the range [-887272, 887272]. If not specified the previous tick of the order id will be used.
- `amount_change`: The desired change [amount](#amounts) as a increase or decrease json object: `{"increase": <amount>}` or `{"decrease": <amount>}`.
- `dispatch_at`: (Optional) Schedules the dispatch of `lp_update_limit_order` on a given block. If the transaction is included after the `dispatch_at` block, it has no effect.

Return:

A chronological list of all the [updates](#order-updates) that were made as a result of the operation. Each item in the list is a JSON object:

Note that during the order's lifetime, swaps may be executed against it, and this results in quantities of the `buy_asset` accumulating. These are swept into the free balance as a result of any update to any order in the same pool. This swept amount is what `bought_amount` refers to.

```json
{
  "sell_asset": <asset>,
  "buy_asset": <asset>,
  "id": <order_id>,
  "tick": <tick>,
  "amount_total": <amount>,
  "collected_fees": <amount>,
  "bought_amount": <amount>,
  "amount_change": { <increase_or_decrease>: <amount> }
}
```

  For example if an `lp_update_limit_order` request moves the limit order, the return would contain two of these, one for the decrease to zero/destruction of the previous order, and then one for the increase/creation of the order with the price/tick.

#### Example:

- Request:

```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "lp_update_limit_order", "params": {"sell_asset": "ETH", "buy_asset": {"chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "USDC"}, "id": "1", "tick": 100, "amount_change": {"decrease": 1 }}}' http://localhost:10589
```

- Response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "result":[
    {
      "sell_asset": { "chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "ETH" },
      "buy_asset": { "chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "USDC" },
      "tick":100,
      "amount_total":0,
      "collected_fees":0,
      "bought_amount":0,
      "amount_change":{ "decrease": 1 }
    }
  ],
  "id":1
}
```

> **_NOTE:_** If you pass the `dispatch_at` parameter the response may not return any results due to the fact that order is not created/updated yet. Instead the `result` array will be empty. The exception to this would be if the transaction is included in the `dispatch_at` block, in which case the operation is executed immediately. If the `dispatch_at` block has already elapsed, this method returns an error.

### `lp_set_limit_order`

Parameters:

- `sell_asset`: Sell [Asset](#assets) as a camel-case string, e.g. "Eth" or "Dot".
- `buy_asset`: Buy [Asset](#assets) as a camel-case string, e.g. "Eth" or "Dot".
- `id`: Numerical [Order ID](#order-ids).
- `tick`: (Optional) Price tick in the range [-887272, 887272]. If not specified the previous tick of the order id will be used.
- `amount`: The desired size of the order, expressed as an [amount](#amounts).
- `dispatch_at`: (Optional) Schedules the dispatch of `lp_set_limit_order` on a given block. If the transaction is included after the `dispatch_at` block, it has no effect.

Return:

- A chronological list of all the [updates](#order-updates) that were made as part of the operation. Each item in the list is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "sell_asset": <asset>,
  "buy_asset": <asset>,
  "id": <order_id>,
  "tick": <tick>,
  "amount_total": <amount>,
  "collected_fees": <amount>,
  "bought_amount": <amount>,
  "amount_change": { <increase_or_decrease>: <amount> }
}
```

  For example if a `lp_set_limit_order` request moves the limit order, the return would contain two of these, one for the decrease to zero/destruction of the previous order, and then one for the increase/creation of the order with the price/tick.

#### Example:

Imagine an order with 1 exists at tick -216338.

- Request:

```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "lp_set_limit_order", "params": {"sell_asset": "ETH", "buy_asset": "USDC", "id": "1", "tick": 100, "amount": 1}}' http://localhost:10589
```

- Response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "result":[
    {
      "sell_asset": { "chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "ETH" },

      "tick": -216338,
      "amount_total":0,
      "collected_fees":0,
      "bought_amount":0,
      "amount_change":{ "decrease": 1 }
    },
    {
      "sell_asset": { "chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "ETH" },
      "buy_asset": { "chain": "Ethereum", "asset": "USDC" },
      "tick": 100,
      "amount_total":1,
      "collected_fees":0,
      "bought_amount":0,
      "amount_change":{ "increase": 1 }
    },
  ],
  "id":1
}
```

> **_NOTE:_** If you pass the `dispatch_at` parameter the response may not return any results due to the fact that order is not created/updated yet. Instead the `result` array will be empty. The exception to this would be if the transaction is included in the `dispatch_at` block, in which case the operation is executed immediately. If the `dispatch_at` block has already elapsed, this method returns an error.

## Working Example

1. Run the LP API server with the following command:
```bash copy
./chainflip-lp-api \
 --state_chain.ws_endpoint ws://localhost:9944 \
 --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key \
 --port 80 # or whatever port you want to use
```
It will print `ðŸŽ™ Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:80.` and continue to run.

2. In another terminal:
Register as an liquidity provider if you are not already.
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "lp_register_account", "params": [0]}' \
    http://localhost:80
```
Returns `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":null,"id":1}`

3. Request a liquidity deposit address:
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "lp_liquidity_deposit", "params": ["Eth"]}' \
    http://localhost:80
```
The response is a hex-encoded deposit address: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x350ec3dfd773978277868212d9f1319cbc93a8bf","id":1}`.

## Limitations

- It doesn't seem to work with **`wss`**, so make sure the address is specified with **`ws`**. It should be ok since we're not going to expose this externally.
