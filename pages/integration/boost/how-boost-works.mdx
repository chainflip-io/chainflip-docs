### Creating a Boost Pool and Adding Liquidity

When a boost pool is first created, the State Chain will emit a `BoostPoolCreated` event, containing the
pools id (an asset/fee_tier pair).
A booster (an [LP account](../../concepts/swaps-amm/liquidity-provider-accounts)) may add funds by calling the `add_boost_funds` extrinsic, specifying the pool
(asset/fee_tier) and the amount of the target asset they wish to add.
Provided the booster has sufficient funds in their "free balance", the specified amount will be debited
from their account and added into the pool's `available_amounts` record next to their account id:

```
available_amounts[account_id] += amount
```

The sum of all entries in `available_amounts` is the maximum amount the pool can contribute to a boost.

### Boosting a Deposit

When the network sees a prewitnessed deposit on a *boostable* channel (one that specifies a non-zero boost
fee limit), it checks if there are enough *available* funds in the given asset's pools that satisfy the fee limit.
If the pools are sufficiently funded, the required amount will be gathered from them in the order of increasing
boost fees, ensuring that the user who initiated the deposit pays the smallest fee.

<Callout type="info">
Alternatively, if the available funds aren't sufficient, the deposit is not boosted, and will be processed
as normal after it is finalised (no boost fee is charged in this case).
</Callout>

The most simple case is when the first pool (one with the lowest fee) has enough funds on its own to boost
a deposit.
In this case the amount the pool charges in fees can be computed as
`fee_amount = deposit_amount * pool_fee_bps / 10000`.

The boosters "keep" the fee, providing only `deposit_amount - fee_amount`, while still expecting to receive
the full `deposit_amount`, effectively earning `fee_amount` once the boost is finalised.
The provided amount is deducted from each booster's `available_amounts` record in proportion to their share
in the "available" side of the pool.
The fee earned in the process is distributed among boosters proportionally to their contribution.
Each booster's contribution and the fee they will earn is recorded in `pending_boosts`.

```
available_amounts[booster_id] -= provided_amount
pending_boosts[deposit_id][booster_id] = provided_amount + boost_fee
```

Part of the amount provided by the pool is used to pay the ingress fee (note that this is different
to regular/unboosted deposits, where the ingress fee is deducted only after the deposit is finalised).
The amount that remains after both boost and ingress fees are deducted is then used according to the deposit
channel's action (e.g. used as input to a swap, or added to liquidity provider's balance).

```
action_amount = deposit_amount - boost_fee - ingress_fee
```

Some time later, when the boosted deposit is finalized, the full `deposit_amount` is added back to the pool
and distributed among boosters according to the deposit's entry in `pending_boosts`, and the entry itself is
then removed.

```
for (booster, owed_amount) in pending_boosts[deposit_id] {
    available_amounts[booster] += owed_amount
}
```

### Boost Risks

If the deposit is not finalised before the channel expires, it is considered lost.
Internally this is done by removing the corresponding record from `pending_boosts` without crediting the boosters.

<Callout type="info">
Note that the losses are distributed fairly among boosters, that is, in proportion to the amounts
they contributed to the said deposit (which is also proportional to the amount in fees they would
receive, had the deposit been finalised).
</Callout>

It is up to each individual booster to determine their risk tolerance for each asset they wish to
boost, and contribute to the pools according to fee levels to price in that risk tolerance.


### Boosting with Multiple Boost Pools

If the first pool (one with the lowest fee) doesn't have enough available funds to boost a deposit
on its own, the protocol will use all of pool's available funds and will attempt to collect the
remaining funds from other pools (as long at their fee doesn't exceed the user's specified limit).
Each pool that participated in a boost has a separate `pending_boosts` storage item recording
the amounts that each pool contributed and the fees that they should receive.
When the deposit is finalised, the received amount will be split according to each pool's
contribution, and each pool will in turn distribute the funds among boosters according to their
respective `pending_boosts` records.
If the protocol is unable to gather enough funds from all available pools, the boost is aborted,
and the deposit will instead be processed as normal when it is finalised (no boost fee will be
charged).

### Removing Liquidity from a Boost Pool

Boosters that no longer wish for their funds to be used in a boost pool may submit a `stop_boosting`
extrinsic (providing asset/fee_tier to identify the pool).
All of the booster's available funds will be moved into their free balance immediately.
If any of the booster's funds are currently used in pending boosts, these funds will only become available
once the corresponding deposits are finalised.
Executing `stop_boosting` additionally sets a flag to tell the protocol that the account's share for the newly
finalised deposits should go into the account's "free balance", rather than becoming available for boosting again.

<Callout type="info">
Users can reset the flag, and thus become active boosters again, by adding funds through `add_boost_funds` extrinsic.
</Callout>

### Example

The protocol creates two boost pools for BTC, one charging a fee of 5 bps, and the other charging 10 bps.
Boosters B1 and B2 are regular state chain accounts with LP role and enough FLIP to submit extrinsics.
Booster B1 adds 3 BTC into the 5 bps pool and another 2 BTC into the 10 bps pool.
Booster B2 adds 1 BTC into the 5 bps pool only.
This is recorded by the protocol as (the amounts are shown in base units/satoshis):

```
// 5 bps pool
available_amounts = {
    B1: 300_000_000,
    B2: 100_000_000,
}


// 10 bps pool
available_amounts = {
    B2: 200_000_000,
}

```

A user opens a deposit channel for a swap with a boost fee limit of 10 bps.
A deposit of 5 BTC is then prewitnessed on that channel by the protocol.

The protocol attempts to gather funds from the 5 bps pool, but it can only provide 4 BTC in total. 
To calculate the amount in fees each booster will receive, we first compute the amount they are able
to "boost" (the portion of the deposited amount considered covered by the pool).
Note that due to how the boost fee is charged, the boosted amount can be greater than the total amount
available in the pool.

```
boosted_amount = provided_amount / (1 - boost_fee)

boosted_by_b1 = 300_000_000 / (1 - 0.0005) = 300_150_075
boosted_by_b2 = 100_000_000 / (1 - 0.0005) = 100_050_025

boosted_total = 300_150_075 + 100_050_025 = 400_200_100
remaining_to_boost = 500_000_000 - 400_200_100 = 99_799_900

```

Here is the state of the 5 bps pool after taking all of its funds for a boost:

```
available_amounts = {
    B1: 0,
    B2: 0,
}
pending_deposits["deposit_1"] = {
    B1: 300150075
    B2: 100050025
}
```

We have exhausted the 5 bps pool, but fortunately there is enough liquidity in the 10 bps pool
(which is within the user's fee limit) to boost the remaining 99_799_900 satoshis.
We use a similar formula to compute the amount that the second pool needs to provide to cover
the remaining amount, and the fee that it will earn by doing so.

```
    boost_fee_amount = boosted_amount * boost_fee = 99_799_900 * 0.001 ~= 99_799
    provided_amount = boosted_amount - boost_fee_amount = 99_799_900 - 99_799 = 99_700_101

```

B2 only needs to provide `99_700_101` satoshis, which is deducted from their `available_amounts`
record, but they will receive `99_799_900` (the amount provided plus the fee), which is recorded
in `pending_deposits`.

Here is the state of the 10 bps pool:

```
pending_deposits["deposit_1"] = {
    ["b2"]: 99_799_900
}
available_amounts = {
    B2: 100_299_899,
}
```

The amount provided by both pools (`400_000_000 + 99_700_101 = 499_700_101`) is what will be used in the
swap (after the ingress fee is payed as well), and the total amount was payed in boost fees is `299899`
(about 6bps on average).

When the deposit is finalised at some point later, the amounts recorded in `pending_deposits` will be
added to `available_amounts`:

```
// 5 bps pool
available_amounts = {
    B1: 300_150_075,
    B2: 100_050_025,
}


// 10 bps pool
available_amounts = {
    B2: 200_099_799,
}

```

The boost fee is now part of the funds available to boost future deposits.
