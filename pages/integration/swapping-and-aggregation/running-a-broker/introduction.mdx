# Introduction to Brokers

The Chainflip Broker API Bundle allows SDK users to run their own _State Chain_ interface.

A Broker, in the context of the Chainflip protocol, is an entity that facilitates the process of initiating a swap on behalf of end users via [Request Deposit Address](../javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address.md "mention"). They provide an endpoint to interact with the State Chain, reducing the complexity of transactions and lowering gas fees.

## How Brokers work

1. Any _State Chain_ account can register as a Broker, and start submitting **Deposit Channel Requests** extrinsics on users' behalf.
2. Once a _Deposit Channel_ is opened, a hash is returned and it can be verified using [Chainflip's Explorer](https://scan.chainflip.io/).
3. Brokers must pay a small transaction fee in \$FLIP for each extrinsic they submit and a "Channel Fee". This is to avoid spam and for network integrity reasons. **The suggested amount to fund the State Chain account is 10 \$FLIP**.

  The cost Brokers pay to open _Deposit Channels_ is **very** cheap. See the \$FLIP balance from [Chainflip's Broker](https://scan.chainflip.io/brokers/cFLRQDfEdmnv6d2XfHJNRBQHi4fruPMReLSfvB8WWD2ENbqj7) â€” used to power our Swapping app.

## How Brokers earn fees

Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint. This fee is denominated in basis points, where a basis point is defined as 1/100th of a percentile and limited to 1000 basis points (equivalent to 10%). This fee is taken from the deposit asset amount and credited to the Broker's account.
