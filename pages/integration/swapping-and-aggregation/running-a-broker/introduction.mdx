# Introduction to Brokers

The Chainflip Broker API Bundle allows SDK users to run their own _State Chain_ interface.

A Broker, in the context of the Chainflip protocol, is an entity that facilitates the process of initiating a swap on behalf of end users via [Request Deposit Address](../javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address.md "mention"). They provide an endpoint to interact with the State Chain, reducing the complexity of transactions and lowering gas fees.

## How Brokers work

1. Any _State Chain_ account can register as a Broker, submitting **Deposit Channel Requests** extrinsics to simplify the end-user experience.
2. Brokers return the extrinsic hash, once a Deposit Channel on the State Chain is opened on behalf of the user. The Deposit Channel can then be verified using [Chainflip's Explorer](https://scan.chainflip.io/)
3. Brokers must pay a small transaction fee in \$FLIP, for each extrinsic they submit. For this reason, the account needs to be funded with a minimum amount of $FLIP. This is to avoid spam and for network integrity reasons.

## How Brokers earn fees

Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint. This fee is denominated in basis points, where a basis point is defined as 1/100th of a percentile and limited to 1000 basis points (equivalent to 10%). This fee is taken from the deposit asset amount and credited to the Broker's account.
