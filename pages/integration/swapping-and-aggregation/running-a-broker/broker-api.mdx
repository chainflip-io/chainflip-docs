# Broker API


The Broker API is a standalone client that exposes _Broker_ functionality via a JSON API interface. It can be obtained from the same location as the chainflip-node, i.e. you can install it via `apt`, use the provided docker image or compile it yourself from the sources on Github.

Brokers need to run the client for the API themselves, as the Broker holds keys used to sign extrinsics and collect any fees set for [Deposit Channels](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers). The API client works by pointing it to an RPC node â€” also run by the same Broker, ideally.

## Running Broker API locally

Before you do anything, you need to generate a valid [signing_key](/mainnet/validator-setup/keys#validator-keys) and [fund](/mainnet/validator-setup/funding-and-bidding#adding-funds-to-your-validator-node) the associated account.
If you are planning to use our [docker setup](/integration/swapping-and-aggregation/running-a-broker/broker-api#running-the-lp-api-with-docker-compose), instructions on how to generate new keys and fund your account are provided in the github repo.

### Using the pre-compiled binaries

Download the broker-api software and the chainflip-node:

```bash copy
apt-get install chainflip-broker-api
apt-get install chainflip-node
```

For a full list of command line arguments, see `chainflip-broker-api --help` and `chainflip-node --help`.

To use the default configuration, run:
- Testnet
    ```bash copy
    chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/perseverance.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe

    chainflip-broker-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key_file
    ```
- Mainnet
    ```bash copy
    chainflip-node --chain /etc/chainflip/berghain.chainspec.json --rpc-methods=unsafe

    chainflip-broker-api --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key_file
    ```

## Running the Broker API with Docker Compose

For a quick start with Broker API, we have provided a docker-compose setup that runs the LP API and a State Chain node.

- [Perseverance Testnet Setup](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-perseverance)
- [Mainnet Setup](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-mainnet-apis)

## Registering the account
After being funded, before you can fully interact with the Broker API, your account needs to be [registered](/integration/swapping-and-aggregation/running-a-broker/broker-api#broker_register_account) as a Broker account.

## Command line arguments and defaults

- The `state_chain.ws_endpoint` should point at a **synced Chainflip State Chain RPC node**. The default is `ws://localhost:9944` assuming it is run locally.
- The `state_chain.signing_key_file` should be the **Broker's private key** for their on-chain account. The account should be [funded](/mainnet/validator-setup/funding-and-bidding#adding-funds-to-your-validator-node). The account type should be set to Broker. The default is `/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file`.
- The `port` is the port on which the Broker will listen for connections. Use `0` to assign a random port. The default is `80`.

```bash copy
./chainflip-broker-api --help
```
```sh
chainflip-broker-api

## RPC Methods

### `broker_request_swap_deposit_address`

Parameters:
- `source_asset`: Source [asset](#assets).
- `destination_asset`: Egress [asset](#assets).
- `destination_address`: Egress [Address](#addresses).
- `broker_commission_bps`: Broker Commission in basis points (100th of a percent). Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint, and can be set at any value from 1 basis point to 1000 basis points.
- `channel_metadata`: (Optional) Cross-chain message metadata as a JSON object: `{"gas_budget": <amount>, "message":<hex_string>, "cf_parameters": <hex_string>}`. Where `message` and `cf_parameters` are hex encoded strings.

Return:

- deposit [address](#foreign-chain-addresses).

### `broker_register_account`

Parameters:

None

Return:

- `null` if successful, otherwise an error.

### `broker_withdraw_fees`

Withdraw all accumulated fees for a given asset.

Parameters:
- `asset`: The [asset](#assets) to withdraw.
- `destination_address`: The [destination address](#addresses) to which the assets should be withdrawn.

Return:
- tx_hash: Hash,
- egress_id: [ForeignChain, Number],
- egress_amount: Amount,
- egress_fee: Amount,
- destination_address: [Address]((#addresses),

Example input:

```bach copy
curl 'http://localhost:10997/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"broker_withdraw_fees","params":{"asset":{"chain":"Ethereum","asset":"ETH"},"destination_address":"0xabababababababababababababababababababab"},"id":1}' | jq
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "tx_hash": "0x736c159fec96ea84b8eceb49258019625a17e68ab981a3a674261e1df00a0482",
    "egress_id": [
      "Ethereum",
      103
    ],
    "egress_amount": 99998499999503000,
    "egress_fee": 490000,
    "destination_address": "0xabababababababababababababababababababab"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

## Working Example

<Callout type="info">
  This example assumes the node that is exposing the Statechain RPC's is
  **funded**.
</Callout>

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash copy
./chainflip-broker-api \
    --state_chain.ws_endpoint=ws://localhost:9944 \
    --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key \
    --port 62378 # or whatever port you want to use
```
It will print `ðŸŽ™ Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:62378.` and continue to run.

2. Open another terminal and run:
Register as a broker if you are not already.
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "broker_register_account"}' \
    http://localhost:62378
```

3. Request a swap deposit address:
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "broker_request_swap_deposit_address", "params": ["ETH", "FLIP","0xabababababababababababababababababababab", 0]}' \
    http://localhost:62378
```
The result is the hex encoded deposit address, channel id, expiry block, and the issued block:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "result":{
        "address":"0xe720e23f62efc931d465a9d16ca303d72ad6c0bc",
        "issued_block":5418,
        "channel_id":6,
        "source_chain_expiry_block":2954
    },
    "id":1
}
```

## Limitations

- The current API architecture supports only **`ws`** and not **`wss`**.

## Reference

### Assets

Assets are specified as a `{ chain, asset }` object, where the [chain](#chains) is as described below, and the asset is an upper-case string.

Where the chain is unambiguous (for example for the native currencies), the asset can be submitted simply as the upper-case string.

For example, for BTC, `"BTC"` and `{ chain: "Bitcoin", asset: "BTC" }` are both valid and resolve to the same asset.

Assets returned from the RPCs will always take the explicit form, for example `{ chain: "Ethereum", asset: "ETH" }`

### Chains

Chains are specified as the full name of the chain, capitalised, for example `"Ethereum"`, `"Bitcoin"`, "`Polkadot"`.

### Addresses

Addresses should be encoded according to their host chains:
- Ethereum addresses should be encoded as Hex strings, for example `"0xfa36e03defc6e4d140cc61fcaab9d1fbef18642f"`.
- Polkadot addresses can be encoded using SS58 or Hex strings, for example: `"13zyEWmmLDx63Y99TL9SkxBe1DqPVCrcjXytxM3ZHGRyEJV5"` or `"0x84aec0876dbb3cb7391eeded2eef5fbcf0d1a34f7c9f86f9af205f944b461761"`
- Bitcoin addresses should be encoded using the appropriate bitcoin standard for the address type. For example `"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx"` is a valid bech32 address on Bitcoin testnet.
