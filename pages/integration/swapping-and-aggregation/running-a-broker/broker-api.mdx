# Broker API

The Broker API is a standalone client that exposes _Broker_ functionality via a JSON API interface.

Brokers need to run the client for the API themselves, as the Broker holds keys used to sign extrinsics and collect any fees set for [Deposit Channels](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers). The API client works by pointing it to an RPC node â€” also run by the same Broker, ideally.

## Command line arguments and defaults

- The `state_chain.ws_endpoint` should point at a **synced Chainflip State Chain RPC node**. The default is `ws://localhost:9944`assuming it is run locally.
- The `state_chain.signing_key_file` should be the **Broker's private key** for their on-chain account. The account should be [funded](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/jk6cWeoa0h57DFwHlHoV/funding/funding#funding-your-account-via-the-validator-dashboard). The account type should be set to Broker. The default is `/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file`.
- The `port` is the port on which the Broker will listen for connections. Use `0` to assign a random port. The default is `80`.

```bash copy
./chainflip-broker-api --help
```
```sh
chainflip-broker-api

USAGE:
    chainflip-broker-api [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --port <PORT>
            The port number on which the broker will listen for connections. Use 0 to assing a
            random port. [default: 80]

        --state_chain.signing_key_file <SIGNING_KEY_FILE>
            A path to a file that contains the broker's secret key for signing extrinsics.
            [default: /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file]

        --state_chain.ws_endpoint <WS_ENDPOINT>
            The state chain node's rpc endpoint. [default: ws://localhost:9944]
```

## RPC Methods

### `broker_request_swap_deposit_address`

Parameters:
- `source_asset`: Source [asset](#assets).
- `destination_asset`: Egress [asset](#assets).
- `destination_address`: Egress [Address](#addresses).
- `broker_commission_bps`: Broker Commission in basis points (100th of a percent). Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint, and can be set at any value from 1 basis point to 1000 basis points.
- `channel_metadata`: (Optional) Cross-chain message metadata as a JSON object: `{"gas_budget": <amount>, "message":<hex_string>, "cf_parameters": <hex_string>}`. Where `message` and `cf_parameters` are hex encoded strings.

Return:

- deposit [address](#foreign-chain-addresses).

### `broker_register_account`

Parameters:

None

Return:

- `null` if successful, otherwise an error.

## Working Example

<Callout type="info">
  This example assumes the node that is exposing the Statechain RPC's is
  **funded**.
</Callout>

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash copy
./chainflip-broker-api \
    --state_chain.ws_endpoint=ws://localhost:9944 \
    --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key \
    --port 62378 # or whatever port you want to use
```
It will print `ðŸŽ™ Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:62378.` and continue to run.

2. Open another terminal and run:
Register as a broker if you are not already.
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "broker_register_account"}' \
    http://localhost:62378
```

3. Request a swap deposit address:
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "broker_request_swap_deposit_address", "params": ["ETH", "FLIP","0xabababababababababababababababababababab", 0]}' \
    http://localhost:62378
```
The result is the hex encoded deposit address, channel id, expiry block, and the issued block:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "result":{
        "address":"0xe720e23f62efc931d465a9d16ca303d72ad6c0bc",
        "issued_block":5418,
        "channel_id":6,
        "source_chain_expiry_block":2954
    },
    "id":1
}
```

## Limitations

- It doesn't seem to work with **`wss`**, so make sure the address is specified with **`ws`**. It should be ok since we're not going to expose this externally.

## Reference

### Assets

Assets are specified as a `{ chain, asset }` object, where the [chain](#chains) is as described below, and the asset is an upper-case string.

Where the chain is unambiguous (for example for the native currencies), the asset can be submitted simply as the upper-case string.

For example, for BTC, `"BTC"` and `{ chain: "Bitcoin", asset: "BTC" }` are both valid and resolve to the same asset.

Assets returned from the RPCs will always take the explicit form, for example `{ chain: "Ethereum", asset: "ETH" }`

### Chains

Chains are specified as the full name of the chain, capitalised, for example `"Ethereum"`, `"Bitcoin"`, "`Polkadot"`.

### Addresses

Addresses should be encoded according to their host chains:
- Ethereum addresses should be encoded as Hex strings, for example `"0xfa36e03defc6e4d140cc61fcaab9d1fbef18642f"`.
- Polkadot addresses can be encoded using SS58 or Hex strings, for example: `"13zyEWmmLDx63Y99TL9SkxBe1DqPVCrcjXytxM3ZHGRyEJV5"` or `"0x84aec0876dbb3cb7391eeded2eef5fbcf0d1a34f7c9f86f9af205f944b461761"`
- Bitcoin addresses should be encoded using the appropriate bitcoin standard for the address type. For example `"tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx"` is a valid bech32 address on Bitcoin testnet.
