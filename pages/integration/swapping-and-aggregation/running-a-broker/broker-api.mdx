# Broker API

The Broker API is a standalone client that exposes _Broker_ functionality via a JSON API interface.

Brokers need to run the client for the API themselves, as the Broker holds keys used to sign extrinsics and collect any fees set for [Deposit Channels](../../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers). The API client works by pointing it to an RPC node â€” also run by the same Broker, ideally.

## Command line arguments and defaults

- The `state_chain.ws_endpoint` should point at a **synced Chainflip State Chain RPC node**. The default is `ws://localhost:9944`assuming it is run locally.
- The `state_chain.signing_key_file` should be the **Broker's private key** for their on-chain account. The account should be [funded](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/jk6cWeoa0h57DFwHlHoV/funding/funding#funding-your-account-via-the-validator-dashboard). The account type should be set to Broker. The default is `/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file`.
- The `port` is the port on which the Broker will listen for connections. Use `0` to assign a random port. The default is `80`.

```bash copy
./chainflip-broker-api --help
```
```sh
chainflip-broker-api

USAGE:
    chainflip-broker-api [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --port <PORT>
            The port number on which the broker will listen for connections. Use 0 to assing a
            random port. [default: 80]

        --state_chain.signing_key_file <SIGNING_KEY_FILE>
            A path to a file that contains the broker's secret key for signing extrinsics.
            [default: /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file]

        --state_chain.ws_endpoint <WS_ENDPOINT>
            The state chain node's rpc endpoint. [default: ws://localhost:9944]
```

## RPC Methods

### `broker_request_swap_deposit_address`

Parameters:

- Source asset as either a string, e.g. "Eth" or "dot", or as an Asset & Chain JSON object, e.g. `{"asset": "Eth", "chain": "Ethereum"}`
- Egress asset as either a string, e.g. "Eth" or "dot", or as an Asset & Chain JSON object, e.g. `{"asset": "dot", "chain": "polkadot"}`
- Egress [Address](#foreign-chain-addresses).
- Broker Commission in basis points (100th of a percent). Broker operators can choose to charge a fee for the use of their endpoint, and can be set at any value from 1 basis point to 1000 basis points.&#x20;

Return:

- deposit [address](#foreign-chain-addresses).

### `broker_register_account`

Parameters:

None

Return:

- `null` if successful, otherwise an error.

## Working Example

<Callout type="info">
  This example assumes the node that is exposing the Statechain RPC's is
  **funded**.
</Callout>

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash copy
./chainflip-broker-api \
    --state_chain.ws_endpoint=ws://localhost:9944 \
    --state_chain.signing_key_file /path/to/my/signing_key \
    --port 62378 # or whatever port you want to use
```
It will print `ðŸŽ™ Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:62378.` and continue to run.

2. Open another terminal and run:
Register as a broker if you are not already.
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "broker_register_account"}' \
    http://localhost:62378
```

3. Request a swap deposit address:
```bash copy
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "broker_request_swap_deposit_address", "params": ["Eth", "Flip","0xabababababababababababababababababababab", 0]}' \
    http://localhost:62378
```
The result is the hex encoded deposit address, expiry block, and the issued block:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"address":"0x4ef7608893d5a06c2689b8d15b4dc400be0954f2",expiry_block:12345},"id":1}
```

The `broker_request_swap_deposit_address` request also accepts cross-chain message metadata as an optional fifth parameter:
```json
{"gas_budget":"0x1000", message:[0,1,2,3,4], cf_parameters: [], source_address: "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa", source_chain: "Bitcoin"}
```

## Limitations

- It doesn't seem to work with **`wss`**, so make sure the address is specified with **`ws`**. It should be ok since we're not going to expose this externally.

## Reference

### Foreign Chain Addresses
When specifying an address on a foreign chain, the format of the address depends on the chain.
- Ethereum: Hex encoded address (With or without `0x` prefix), e.g. `0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F`
- Polkadot: SS58 encoded address, e.g. `5EYCAe1J1tZx5VX1d6hYt1JqjvY5qoUWQ7Q7Q7Q7Q7Q7Q7Q7`
- Bitcoin: Base58 encoded address, e.g. `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`
