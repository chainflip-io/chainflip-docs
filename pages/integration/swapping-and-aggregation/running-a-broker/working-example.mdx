# Working Example

## Running a Broker API locally

To run the Broker API locally, head to [this](https://github.com/chainflip-io/chainflip-perseverance) repo on Github and follow the instructions.

## Deployment Schema

Brokers (and LPs) should ideally run their own local RPC nodes. These nodes connect to the network and expose the LP & Broker APIs locally to the backend they want to use.

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid using the public RPC node since its particularly vulnerable to DDOS or
  other various attacks
