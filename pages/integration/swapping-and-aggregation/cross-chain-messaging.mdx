# Cross-chain Messaging

## Overview

Chainflip's Cross-chain Messaging (CCM) capabilities allow developers to not just swap native tokens between chains but also call smart contracts passing arbitrary messages to the destination chain.

Chainflip's unique architecture enables interoperability between non-smart contract chains and smart contract chains that goes beyond the simple transfer of assets. As described in [How Swapping Works](how-swapping-works.md), swaps in Chainflip can be initiated via a [smart contract call](evm-integration/vault-swaps.md) and via [requesting deposit addresses](javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address.md). The latter allows for the initiation of a swap in a non-smart contract blockchain containing a message that executes the desired logic on the destination chain.

This feature enables for a large degree of interoperability between chains and opens up the opportunity for all kinds of applications to be built on top such as cross-chain DEX aggregation.


## Requirements

- The destination chain needs to be a Chainflip supported EVM-compatible chain
- The gas budget needs to be paid upfront on the source chain. In the future Chainflip might support paying the gas budget on the destination chain.
- The gas budget provided needs to be sufficient to cover the gas costs of the receiver's logic on the destination chain, otherwise the transaction won't be broadcasted.
- The receiver on the destination chain needs to be a smart contract with the interface described [here](evm-integration/vault-swaps.md#receive-a-destination-asset-and-contract-call).
- The receiver on the destination chain needs to ensure that the receiving logic won't revert.

For more implementation details about the smart contract implementation see [Vault](evm-integration/vault-swaps.md).


## Step by step example

1. The user has BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and wants to swap it to coin USDC on Ethereum blockchain and then execute some logic on a smart contract.
2. The user requests a bitcoin deposit address as described [here](javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address.md#requestdepositaddress--cross-chain-messaging-ccm). As mentioned before, if the source chain were EVM-compatible chain, this could be initiated via a smart contract call.
3. The user specifies as part of requesting a deposit adddress two additional parameters, the `message` and `gasBudget`. The message can be an arbitrary hex-encoded sequence of bytes. The `gasBudget` is the amount of the source token that will be used to pay for gas. 
4. The user transfers an amount to swap.
5. Chainflip will swap the `gasBudget` amount to the destination chain's native token to pay for gas (ETH in this case) and the remainder of the input amount (input amount minuts `gasBudget`) will be swapped to the destination token (USDC). Therefore, that input swap amount must always be larger than `gasBudget` amount destined for gas.
6. After the threshold signature is completed, a transaction originating from the Vault contract will transfer the destination token to the specified receiver address on the destination chain and make a call to that address with a specific interface passing the user's message.
7. The receiver contract will execute its logic, which can entail decoding the received messaged from the source chain and acting accordingly. For example, it could then swap USDC into a long tail asset in a Uniswap pool.
