# Swap Assets

## Supported methods

Chainflip swaps are **fire-and-forget**, meaning once the deposit is made, the user doesn't need to do anything for the swap to take place.&#x20;

There are two main ways to initiate a swap:

1. **Creating a deposit channel** via a [Broker]() in order to get a deposit address. See [Request Deposit Address](request-deposit-address.md).
2. **Calling the Vault smart contracts directly**, via the `swap()` or `call()` functions â€” for EVM-only chains. See [Execute Swap](execute-swap.md).

  If you haven't yet, make sure you read [How Swapping Works](../../how-swapping-works.md) and [Swapping Basics](../../swapping-basics.md) to better understand how to execute your first swap.
