# Get channel opening fees

## getChannelOpeningFees

Returns the fee in Flipperino required to open a deposit channel for a chain.

```typescript copy
export type ChainMap<T> = {
  Bitcoin: T;
  Ethereum: T;
  Polkadot: T;
};

class SwapSDK {
  getChannelOpeningFees(): Promise<ChainMap<bigint>>;
}
```

When a broker opens a swap deposit channel, there is a fee that must be paid
from the $FLIP balance of the account on the State Chain. The fee is measured in
Flipperino which is the smallest unit of $FLIP (1 $FLIP = 10^18 Flipperino).
This fee is determined per chain.

### Example


```javascript
console.log(await swapSDK.getChannelOpeningFees());
```

### Sample Response

```ts
{
  Bitcoin: 0n,
  Ethereum: 0n,
  Polkadot: 0n,
}
```
