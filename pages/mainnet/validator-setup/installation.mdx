# Getting the Validator Software

This guide describes how to download and run Chainflip's validator software.

## Prerequisites
It's a good practice to use a fresh node and upgrade all system dependencies before installing the validator software.

```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Adding Chainflip's `apt` Repo

We distribute our binaries as debian packages through our `apt` repository. To install the packages, you need to add our repo to your `apt` sources list.

Use the following commands to add Chainflip's **Mainnet** `apt` repo to your node:

1. Download Chainflip Mainnet GPG key from the **Ubuntu Key Server**:

```bash copy
gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37
```

2. Verify the key's authenticity:

```bash copy
gpg --export 4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37 | gpg --show-keys
```

<Callout type="warning">
    **Important:** Make sure you see the following output from the terminal:

    ```
    pub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [SC]
        4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37
    uid                      Chainflip Labs GmbH (Releaser Master Key) <security@chainflip.io>
    sub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [S] [expires: 2024-11-05]
    sub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [S] [expires: 2024-11-05]
    sub   rsa4096 2023-11-06 [S] [expires: 2024-11-05]
    ```
</Callout>

3. Add Chainflip's Mainnet Repo to `apt` sources list:

<Callout type="info">
Mainnet binaries were compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). Running them on other versions of Ubuntu or other Debian-like distributions may require additional dependencies and configuration.
</Callout>

```bash copy
mkdir -p /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d
gpg --export 4E506212E4EF4E0D3E37E568596FBDCACBBCDD37 > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-mainnet.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/chainflip-mainnet.gpg] https://pkgs.chainflip.io/ubuntu/ jammy berghain" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip-berghain-mainnet.list
```

## Installing The Packages

To install, run the following commands:

```bash copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine1.0
```

# Docker Installation

<Callout type="warning">
If you have done the **APT Installation** above, you don't need to do the **Docker Installation**.
</Callout>

If you are planning to run a validator using a container orchestration system like Kubernetes you can use our pre-built images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/chainfliplabs).

```bash copy
docker pull chainfliplabs/chainflip-node:berghain-1.0.0
docker pull chainfliplabs/chainflip-engine:berghain-1.0.0
docker pull chainfliplabs/chainflip-cli:berghain-1.0.0
```

## Starting up the node in Docker
To start the node, you would need the following options passed to the `chainflip-node` binary:

```bash copy
chainflip-node \
  --chain=/path/to/chainflip/dir/berghain.chainspec.json \
  --base-path=/path/to/chainflip/dir/chaindata \
  --node-key-file=/path/to/chainflip/dir/keys/node_key_file \
  --validator \
  --trie-cache-size=0 \
  --sync=warp
```

# Getting the chainspec
If you have installed binaries through APT, the chainspec is already included in the `chainflip-node` package. However, if you need the chainspec for Kubernetes deployments or other docker orchestration systems, you can download it by running:

```bash copy
curl https://repo.chainflip.io/chainspecs/berghain.chainspec.json -o berghain.chainspec.json
```
