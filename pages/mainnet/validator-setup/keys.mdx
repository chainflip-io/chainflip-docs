# Generating Validator Keys

Validator nodes take actions on behalf of the Chainflip network, and all of these actions are authorised using cryptographic keys. Specifically, to run a validator node, you will need two private/public key pairs: an Ethereum key pair for interacting with Ethereum, and a Chainflip-native key pair for interacting with the State Chain.

## Validator Keys

Generate and save the required keys using the following `chainflip-cli` command:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli generate-keys --path /etc/chainflip/keys
```

This should give you an output similar to the following:

```log
Generated fresh Validator keys for your Chainflip Node!
⁣
🔑 Node Public Key: 0x....
🔑 Ethereum Public Key: 0x...
👤 Ethereum Address: 0x...
🔑 Validator Public Key: 0x...
👤 Validator Account ID: cFxxxx
⁣
🌱 Seed Phrase: SOME SEED
⁣
⁣
❗️❗️
❗️ THIS SEED PHRASE ALLOWS YOU TO RECOVER YOUR CHAINFLIP ACCOUNT KEYS AND ETHEREUM KEYS.
❗️ HOWEVER, THIS SEED PHRASE SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS UTILITY. NOTABLY,
❗️ IT CANNOT BE USED TO IMPORT YOUR ETHEREUM ADDRESS INTO METAMASK OR ANY OTHER WALLET IMPLEMENTATION.
❗️ THIS IS BY DESIGN: THIS ETHEREUM KEY SHOULD BE USED EXCLUSIVELY BY YOUR CHAINFLIP NODE.
❗️❗️
⁣
⁣
💾 Saved all secret keys to '/etc/chainflip/keys'.
```

**Make sure to back up your Seed Phrase and make a note of the public keys and account ID. You will need the Seed Phrase if you ever need to restore your node or recover your funds if you lose access to the node. DO NOT LOSE THIS.**

<Callout type="info">
We recommend generating keys on the validator machine then using GPG encryption to securely transfer the ciphertext to a backup location. This is to eleminate the risk of the keys being intercepted in transit or being cached in the clipboard in the case of copying them from the terminal.
</Callout>

*If the above command returned any errors, please ensure that the provided --path is accessible and that there are no keys already stored there! For security reasons, the files will not be overwritten automatically, so if you want to replace the stored keys, please make sure to move the old ones first, and back them up somewhere.*

Take special note of the **Validator Account ID** beginning with `cF`. This is the ID that you will need to add funds and track your node.

<Callout type="error">**NEVER REVEAL YOUR PRIVATE KEYS TO ANYONE.**</Callout>

### Setting Up Your Validator's Ethereum Account

You must ensure that the public Ethereum address generated above has at least **0.1 ETH**. This requirement is subject to change based on Ethereum transaction fees but for now should be sufficient.

<Callout type="warning">Please also note that the Ethereum key is for the exclusive use of the Validator node. **Do not re-use this key elsewhere.**</Callout>

### Final Checks

The *private* keys generated above should have been stored at the path provided to the `generate-keys` command. As a sanity check, make sure they are where you expect.

Run the following command:

```bash copy
ls -la /etc/chainflip/keys
```

this should show that there are three freshly created files:

```log
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Nov 14 13:28 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Nov 14 13:38 ..
-rw------- 1 root root   64 Nov 14 13:28 ethereum_key_file
-rw------- 1 root root   64 Nov 14 13:28 node_key_file
-rw------- 1 root root   64 Nov 14 13:28 signing_key_file
```

## Recovering Your Keys

In case you lose access to your node, you can recover the private keys using the seed phrase. Using the example phrase generated above:

```bash copy
chainflip-cli generate-keys \
    --path /etc/chainflip/keys \
    --seed-phrase 'SOME_SEED'
```

The output should be the same as above, and the keys should be written to the provided path, as above.

## Cleaning Up After Yourself

The following commands will ensure that only the current user can read the files, and that the private keys are not available in your shell history:

```bash copy
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
history -c
```
