# Important Notes

## Read the Docs

We highly recommend reading our docs thoroughly to understand how the Chainflip network operates.

- [Concepts](../../concepts/welcome)
- [The Validator Network](../../concepts/validator-network/the-state-chain)

## Applying changes to your Node or Engine

The Chainflip network relies on validators running two binaries, the `chainflip-node` and the `chainflip-engine`. The `chainflip-node` is a blockchain node, responsible for communicating with and authoring blocks on the Network; the `chainflip-engine` runs alongside the node, and is responsible for witnessing external block chain events, and maintaining the validator's share of a the sharded threshold signature key underlying the security of Chainflip's vaults.

You can think of the `chainflip-node` as a node of any other proof-of-stake blockchain. It has to be up all the time and connected to the network.

The `chainflip-engine` is a bit different. It acts as a multi-signature crypto wallet and it performs its cryptographic operations using its share of the key generated in the current authority set. The `chainflip-engine` has also to be up at all times.

You might want to update your engine config to use a different RPC endpoint or to update the public IP address of your validator node. Or you might want to start your node with additional flags or update any other node config. That is generally fine, but you should be aware of the following:


<Callout type="warning">

**DO NOT** restart the `chainflip-node` and the `chainflip-engine` at the same time, unless absolutely necessary. This means you should decouple the node and engine deployments if you are using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Compose.

</Callout>

- In case you want to change the location of your chaindata, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Stop your `chainflip-node` (This will make the engine enter a crash loop. That is expected due to the state chain node not being available.)
2. Move the chaindata to the new location
3. Update the location of the chaindata using the `base_path` argument in `/etc/systemd/system/chainflip-node.d/override.conf`
4. Start the `chainflip-node`

- If you want to change the location of your engine keyshares (located at `/etc/chainflip/data.db` by default), you can do so by following these steps:

1. Stop your `chainflip-engine`
2. Move the engine keyshares to the new location
3. Update the location of the engine keyshares in the `signing.db_file` item in `/etc/chainflip/config/Settings.toml`
4. Start the `chainflip-engine`

## Backups

It is crucial to have a backup and recovery strategy in place due to the possibility of data loss or corruption caused by hardware failures, unexpected interruptions from cloud providers, loss of access to the machine, or accidental deletion.

To ensure a quick and easy recovery, we suggest configuring hard disk snapshots. Additionally, it is recommended to mount three volumes and use them to store the chaindata, validator keys and engine keyshares. This adds an extra layer of resilience in case of computing layer failures and simplifies the recovery process.

### Validator Keys

By default, these keys are stored under `/etc/chainflip/keys`. These are the keys used by the `chainflip-engine` to communicate with and authenticate over the network.

These keys are extremely important and should be treated with the utmost care. Losing them can result in a loss of funds and compromise the security of your validator. It is crucial to keep them safe and secure.

If you *do* lose access to these keys, you can [recover your validator account](/mainnet/validator-setup/keys#recovering-your-keys) and restore it to a state where it can participate in the network again.

However, there are important considerations to keep in mind:

- These keys are separate from the session keys and engine key shares. The latter are *not* recoverable from a seed.
- If you only backed up your validator keys without backing up your session keys or engine key shares, your validator will be penalized for missing authorship slots even if you rejoin the network and submit heartbeats. This is because session keys are rotated at the beginning of every epoch, so your rejoining will not be effective until after the next rotation.
- The same applies to engine key shares. Losing these keys will prevent you from participating in keygen ceremonies or performing any multi-signature operations. Failing a keygen will result in penalties and a potential ban, which could lead to your validator node being removed from the authority set. In such cases, you would have to wait for the next auction to rejoin.
- If you think the keys might be compromised, we recommend that you immediately secure your FLIP funds by [binding a redeem address](/testnet/funding/advanced-account-management#redemption-execution-address-binding), [stopping your bid](/mainnet/validator-setup/funding-and-bidding) and then, when your funds are unbonded, redeeming them to your wallet before staking a new node with new keys.

### Chaindata and Session Keys

Chaindata and session keys are stored under `/etc/chainflip/chaindata/chains/Chainflip-Berghain/`. All of this data is required to author new blocks. If any of this data is lost or corrupted, the `chainflip-node` will not function correctly and your account will likely lose out on rewards and/or get slashed.

Session keys are used by the `chainflip-node` for authoring blocks and are stored in the substrate keystore. By default the `keystore` is a directory is under the chaindata directory.

<Callout type="warning">

You should back up your session keys. If you lose these irrecoverably, you will miss out on up to two Epochs' worth of rewards: your node won't be able to author blocks for the remainder of the current epoch, and will be banned from the next keygen ceremony.

If you *do* lose your session keys irrecoverably, run `sudo chainflip-cli --config-root /etc/chainflip rotate` to generate and register a fresh key. However note that key cannot become active until the following epoch.

</Callout>

To ensure faster recovery of the `chainflip-node`'s ability to author blocks for the network, it is important to back up your session keys located at: `/etc/chainflip/chaindata/chains/Chainflip-Berghain/keystore/`.

Backing up the chaindata can speed up recovery in case of data loss, however this is not essential: the data can be recovered from the network. The fastest way to recover by syncing to the network is to use the `--sync=warp` argument when syncing from scratch.

### Engine Keyshares

The keyshares use by the `chainflip-engine` are stored in a database. By default this is located at `/etc/chainflip/data.db`.

Note it is *not* possible to recover these key shares from a seed if they are lost, so it it crucial to back up this database.

<Callout type="warning">

It is *highly* recommended to continuously backup your engine keyshare database as the network generates fresh keys for every epoch.

The key shares collectively secure all the funds on the Chainflip network so should be treated with the utmost attention to their safety and security.
