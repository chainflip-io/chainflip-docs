# Introduction

## Integration Documentation

Welcome to the Chainflip Integration Documentation. Our goal with this documentation is to enhance your Developer Experience in three key ways:

1. **Educate:** We aim to familiarize developers with the fundamental concepts of the Chainflip Protocol. This includes its core features like **swapping** and **liquidity provisioning**, among others.
2. **Enable Integration:** Our documentation provides detailed instructions, practical code examples, and best practices for integrating the Chainflip Protocol into your projects using our JavaScript SDK and API bundles. We cover everything from setting up your development environment to handling responses and errors.
3. **Support Development:** We offer comprehensive troubleshooting guides, FAQ sections, and additional resources to help you efficiently overcome any challenges you might encounter during the integration process. We also provide support channels for further assistance.

Whether you're looking to integrate cross-chain swapping functionality, enable liquidity provision, or simply explore the potential of the Chainflip Protocol, this guide will serve as a valuable resource.

As you navigate this documentation, you'll find the structure based on specific use cases:

## Swapping and Aggregation

Chainflip's swapping functionality enables users to seamlessly swap assets across different chains and networks. Despite the complexity behind the scenes, the swap process provides a smooth and efficient experience for the end user.

If you're interested in building a cross-chain swapping experience, start with our [Swapping Basics](swapping-and-aggregation/swapping-basics.mdx) docs. You'll find everything you need to integrate Chainflip into your own application.

Aggregation, in this context, involves combining multiple protocols for a route from asset A to asset B. This is made possible thanks to our Cross-Chain Messaging (CCM) feature, which allows partners to easily integrate with the Chainflip protocol. See our [How Swapping Works](swapping-and-aggregation/how-swapping-works.md) to learn how it's done.

## Liquidity Provision

The Liquidity Provision (LP) API bundle allows liquidity providers to place orders programmatically through the Just-In-Time AMM. This is achieved by connecting to the State Chain client using Websockets and RPC calls, a method typical of centralized exchanges. This design eliminates the need for complex middleware to translate blockchain activity into instructions compatible with typical market-making software, setting us apart from other DEXes.

If you're interested in providing liquidity, start with our [Liquidity Provision Guide](liquidity-provision/liquidity-provision-basics.mdx).
